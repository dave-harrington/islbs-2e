## Case study: Preventing peanut allergies {#sec-case-study-preventing-peanut-allergies}

\index{data!LEAP|(}

Is there an effective way to prevent peanut allergies in young children?

The proportion of young children in Western countries with peanut allergies has doubled in the last 10 years. Some studies have suggested that exposing infants to peanut-based foods, rather than excluding those foods from their diets, may help prevent peanut allergies (see @du2008early). The "Learning Early about Peanut Allergy" (LEAP) ^[@du2015randomized] study was conducted in a controlled setting to investigate whether early exposure to peanut products reduces the likelihood of developing a peanut allergy.

The study team enrolled children in the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2009, selecting  640 infants between  4  and  11  months old who had eczema, an egg allergy, or both. Each child was randomly assigned to one of two groups: the peanut consumption (treatment) group or the peanut avoidance (control) group. Children in the treatment group were fed at least 6 grams of peanut protein daily until 5 years of age, while children in the control group avoided peanut protein during the same period.  Each child was administered a skin test for a peanut allergy at the time of random assignment.  The outcome of the test was recorded, but children with either outcome (positive or negative) were enrolled

At age 5, each child underwent a peanut allergy test using an oral food challenge (OFC), which involved consuming 5 grams of peanut protein in a single dose. If a child showed no allergic reaction, the outcome was labeled a PASS; if the child exhibited an allergic reaction, the outcome was recorded as a FAIL.

The primary analysis presented in the paper was based on data from  530 children with a negative skin test at study entry. Although a total of 542 children had an earlier negative skin test, data were unavailable for 12 children.

The  [`LEAP`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/LEAP.html)LEAP data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.  Individual-level data from the study are shown in @tbl-leap-study-results-df, which shows 6 children from the dataset restricted to children with a negative skin prick test at the time of randomization. Each row represents a participant and shows the `participant.ID` (an anonymous participant identifier), `treatment.group` (the treatment randomly assigned) and `overall.V60.outcome` (result of the OFC at 60 months of age). 

```{r leap-trimmed}
#| label:  tbl-leap-study-results-df
#| tbl-cap:  "Five patients from the LEAP study"
#| tbl-pos: H

LEAP_trimmed <- LEAP |>

  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"),
    latex_options = c("striped"),
    full_width = FALSE)
```

The data can be organized in a two-way contingency table; @tbl-leap-study-results shows the results grouped by treatment group and OFC outcome.

  dplyr::filter(!is.na(overall.V60.outcome))

 )
```

The table makes it easy to identify patterns in the data. In the two groups combined, the intervention failed to prevent an allergy in 15.6% (41/530) of the children, but the proportions of failures in the two groups are different: 36/263 = 0.137  (13.7%) in the avoidance group versus  5/267 = 0.019  (1.9%) in the consumption group.

The difference in the proportions of OFC failures between the two groups is  11.8% ; nearly  12%  more of the participants tested positive in the avoidance versus than consumption groups. The data can also be summarized by the ratio the two proportions (0.137/0.019 = 7.31); the rate of a subsequent allergy the avoidance group is more than  7  times larger than in the consumption group; i.e., the risk of a subsequent peanut allergy was more than 7 times greater in the avoidance group relative to the consumption group.

Even without advanced statistical methods, the results of the LEAP study are striking. Early exposure to peanut products appears to be an effective strategy for reducing the likelihood of developing peanut allergies later in life.  Is it reasonable to assume that the consumption of peanut products caused the reduction in the proportion of allergies? 

In the language of medical research, LEAP was a \index{clinical trial} **clinical trial** -- a study done to improve the understanding of an intervention in a clinical setting. In statistical terms, LEAP was an \index{experiment} **experiment** involving human subjects, also called participants, -- a study done in a controlled setting to estimate the difference in outcome between two interventions. 

This study illustrates important issues in \index{evidence-based medicine} **evidence-based medicine**. At the time of the study, the prevailing approach to preventing peanut allergies in at-risk children was to avoid peanut products altogether. LEAP was pivotal in challenging this belief, providing evidence that avoidance, while intuitive, was not the most effective strategy. In 2017 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases issued [new guidelines](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/addendum-peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines.pdf) for the management of children susceptible to peanut allergies based largely on the findings in LEAP.

Importantly, the study required informed consent from parents to allow their children to be randomly assigned to one of two interventions with uncertain outcomes. In return investigators were obligated to ensure that the study was justified by preliminary data, had a statistically sound design, and was conducted responsibly to protect the well-being of the participants. ^[The 2024 update to the World Medical Association Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Participants (also known as the Declaration of Helsinki) can be found in

## Experiments {#sec-experiments}

LEAP was a designed  experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of peanut consumption in reducing the likelihood of a child to develop a peanut allergy.  Like all good studies, it was based on a specific research question: does peanut consumption reduce the likelihood of a peanut allergy compared to peanut avoidance.  In addition, it included a specification of the response variable:  the outcome to an oral food challenge at age 5.   Equally importantly, the study design of was based on the four main principles of experimental design: control, randomization, replication and blocking.  

1. **Control**  When selecting participants for a study, researchers \index{control} **control** for extraneous variables and choose a sample of participants that is representative of the population of interest. For example, participation in a study might be restricted to individuals who have a condition that suggests they may benefit from the intervention being tested. Infants enrolled in the LEAP study were required to be between 4 and 11 months of age, with severe eczema and/or allergies to eggs.  The infants in the consumption group were fed at least 6gms of peanut protein per week.

2. **Randomization** Randomly assigning patients to treatment groups ensures that groups are balanced (on average) with respect to both known and unknown variables.  Since the \index{randomization} **randomization** operates independently of other variables it eliminates confounding: there should be no variables associated with both treatment and outcome.  For example, randomization in the LEAP study ensures that the proportion of males to females is approximately the same in both groups. Additionally, perhaps some infants were more susceptible to peanut allergy because of an undetected genetic condition; under randomization, it is reasonable to assume that such infants were present in approximately equal numbers in both groups. By eliminating confounding, the treatments received is the only systematic difference between the two groups and differences in outcome between the groups can  be reasonably attributed to the treatment.

3. **Replication** The results of a study conducted on a larger number of cases are more reliable than in smaller studies.  In a single study, \index{replication} **replication** is accomplished by collecting a sufficiently large sample. The LEAP study randomized a total of 640 infants.

4. **Blocking** Experiments use \index{blocking} **blocking** when there are a small number of variables other than the intervention may have an important on influence the response. Participants are grouped into \term{blocks} according to certain attributes and then randomized to treatment group within each block. This aspect of a design is also referred to as \index{stratifying} **stratifying**. The LEAP study team stratified infants into two cohorts based on the outcome of the skin test at enrollment: the presence or absence of a red, swollen mark (a wheal).  Infants were then randomized between peanut consumption and avoidance groups within each block. 

@fig-leap-design illustrates the design of LEAP.

There are important additional features in the design of experiments present with human subjects.

**Consent** Nearly all countries require that human subjects participating in a clinical trial be informed about the goals of the study, as well as its potential benefit or harm, and sign an informed consent acknowledging agreement to participate.  In the United States this requirement is monitored by 
[The Food and Drug Administration](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-50) and  [The Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-46).  There are rare exceptions to this requirement.

**Blinding**.  Knowledge of the treatment assigned to a participant can effect the assessment of the response.  If, for instance, a participant knows they are receiving an experimental treatment for depression, they may be more likely to report the treatment is working. To prevent this, participants are usually not told their treatment assignment and the study is said to be \index{blind} **blind**.  To maintain the blind, one of the treatments might be a \index{placebo} **placebo**, an inert substance administered the same way as the experimental treatment.  In chronic diseases where it is not ethical to treat a participant in a trial, a current standard treatment is used instead of a placebo.  

When researchers administering the treatment or assessing the response might be affected by knowing the treatment, they are also blinded to the treatment.  For instance, a psychiatrist might assess a participants depression differently if the clinician is aware the participant is being given an experimental treatment.  Studies in which both the participant and members of the research team are not told the assigned treatment are called \index{double blind} **double blind**.

Blinding is not always possible.  The parents of the infants participating in LEAP knew whether or not the child was consuming peanut based material.  Because the response to the experiment was measured by the outcome to an oral food challenge, blinding was not necessary.

A gardener with a plot of land wishes to test two types of fertilizer for rose bushes.  His plot measures 12 $\times$ 12 meters.  Fortunately, this gardener is compulsive; for better access to the of bushes he plans to organize his garden in a checkerboard pattern of 16 3 $\times$ 3 meter squares.  Each row will have two square plots with and without bushes.  The first row will have bushes in the first and third plots, the second row in the 2^nd^ and 4^th^ plots, etc.  

How might he design an experiment to evaluate the fertilizers. Be sure to specify a question to investigate and a response variable.

----------------------------

There are many possible answers.  The specific research question would be which fertilizer produces the healthier rose bushes, assessed with the response variable the number of blossoms on a each bush.

Control: Apart from the fertilizer he wishes to test, all the bushes should cared for the same way.  The control treatment (no fertilizer) should be clearly specified. All the bushes should be of the same variety and each square plot should contain the same number of bushes.  They should be watered on the frequency at the same time of day.  

Randomization:  Each square plot should be randomly assigned to fertilizer versus control.

Replication: It seems reasonable to plant 3 bushes in each plot with plants, leading to 24 total plants.

Blocking: Within each row, the gardener should randomly assign 2 plots to fertilizer and 2 to control.

Blinding:  Unless someone else cares for the garden, the gardener cannot be blinded to the treatment, unless he can find an inert substance (a placebo!) that looks identical to the fertilizer.  He can be blinded to the evaluation, however, by asking someone who was not aware  of the treatment to count the blossoms on each bush.

Suppose a large hospital plans to test a new method of insuring its physician assistants (PAs) conduct a complete set measurements of vital signs and symptoms at its outpatient  clinic. Currently, PAs attend a training session designed for one of the four specialties (general medicine, pediatrics, cardiology and dermatology) in which they see patients. They are allowed to see patients after passing an exam at the end of the session. The hospital is considering eliminating the training session and instead equipping PAs with an electronic checklist on a tablet. All 4 specialties will use the same checklist for screening signs and symptoms.

Each June, the organization hires 80 new PAs who have just completed a degree program.  If possible, PAs are assigned to their program of choice, and typically at least 16 elect each of the practices.

Describe how each of the principles experimental design might be used in an experiment to evaluate the new checklist.  Be sure to specify a response variable and how it will be measured.

------------------------------------------

The simplest response variable would be whether or not the PA conducted a complete exam, as evaluated by the supervising clinician.

Control:  The study should be limited to the 80 new PAs hired each June, since their level of knowledge should be about the same.  The signs and symptoms should be assessed in a private exam room so that PAs in the same practice are not aware of what  method their colleagues are using.

Randomization:  At the time of hiring, each PA should be randomized to use the checklist or attend a training session.

Replication:  The hospital should enroll as many of the new PAs as possible in the program.

Blocking: Since PAs may differ according to their preferred setting (pediatrics versus dermatology, for instance), the randomization should blocked (stratified) by specialty.

Blinding: It will not be possible to blind the PAs to their intervention, but the clinician evaluating the PA exams should be blinded.

Consent:  Each PA should be informed that they are participating in an experiment and given the opportunity to decline participation.

These principles have been used studies that have changed the practice of medicine and to shape public policy.  The Salk vaccine trials ^[@francis1955evaluation; @meier1972biggest] conducted in 1954 - 1955 established that the vaccine was effective at preventing polio based on the results of 401,974 children randomized the the vaccine versus a placebo.  More recently, a study of 42,548 participants established the efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine ^[@polack2020safety]. Small studies can be effective as well.  A 1994 study ^[@connor1994hiv] of 477 women showed  that the drug AZT was effective in reducing the rate of mother to child transmission to when HIV-infected women gave birth and changed the treatment of pregnant, HIV-positive women worldwide.
