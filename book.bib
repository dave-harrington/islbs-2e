title={OpenSAFELY: factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients},
journal={Nature},
year={2020},
month={Jul},
day={08},
abstract={COVID-19 has rapidly affected mortality worldwide1. There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, requiring new approaches for timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, here we created OpenSAFELY: a secure health analytics platform covering 40{\backslash}{\%} of all patients in England, holding patient data within the existing data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59, 95{\backslash}{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.53--1.65); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people with white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48, 1.30--1.69 and 1.44, 1.32--1.58, respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for COVID-19-related death in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. OpenSAFELY is rapidly adding further patients'records; we will update and extend results regularly.},

Paternal alcohol exposure biologically increases the risk of genetic and epigenetic sperm abnormalities. The epidemiological association is less evident and likely interfered with by maternal confounders, such as a maternal alcohol consumption rate as high as 30\\% in Western countries. Our previous preconception care project showed that among Chinese married couples, who were a unique study population, nearly one-third of fathers and only 3\\% of mothers consumed alcohol before pregnancy, suggesting minor effects of maternal alcohol consumption on offspring, and the Chinese population is a good model to analyze the association of preconception paternal drinking and birth defect. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between paternal drinking before pregnancy and birth defects to provide supportive evidence for paternal alcohol cessation in preconception health care.}",
