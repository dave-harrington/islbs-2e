Suppose a healthy couple deciding whether to conceive a child learns from genetic testing that they both carry the gene for cystic fibrosis but are unaffected by the disease.  What is the likelihood that their child will have the disease?   When a rapid antigen self-test for COVID-19 shows a positive outcome, how likely is it that the person using the test has the infection?  

Probability is used to quantify uncertainty, and the rules of probability can be used to answer both questions.  In some cases, probabilities can be calculated directly without formulas, while in others the rules and formulas for probability provide tools for breaking down complex problems into a series of simpler steps.
:::


## Two examples: genetic screening before conception and rapid antigen testing for COVID-19 {#sec-two-examples}

### Screening for cystic fibrosis {#sec-screening-cf}

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene located on chromosome 7. Defective copies of *CFTR* can result in a reduced quantity and function of the CFTR protein, leading to the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs and pancreas.^[The CFTR protein is responsible for transporting sodium and chloride ions across cell membranes.] CF is an autosomal recessive disorder; an individual only develops CF if they have inherited two affected copies of *CFTR*. Individuals with one normal (wild-type) copy and one defective (mutated) copy are known as *carriers*; they do not develop CF, but may pass the disease-causing mutation onto their offspring.

Suppose that both members of a couple are CF carriers. What is the probability that a child of this couple will be affected by CF? Assume that a parent has an equal chance of passing either gene copy (i.e., allele) to a child.

The upper left of @fig-cfInheritance shows mutated (with a red bar) and wild-type (with no red bar) maternal and paternal alleles on chromosome 7.  The four possible genotypes for a child  are shown in the lower right. Chromosomes with the wild-type and mutated versions of *CFTR* are marked with $+$ and $-$, respectively. The child is affected only if they have two mutated copies of *CFTR*, that is have genotype ($-$/$-$) in the lower right corner. Each of the four outcomes occurs with equal likelihood, so the child will be affected with probability 1-in-4, or 1/4.

### Rapid self-tests for COVID-19 {#sec-rat-covid}

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid antigen tests (RAT) have been used for self-tests for the virus, i.e., tests that individuals could self-administer.   The tests continue to be available at pharmacies, neighborhood health centers, libraries and other distribution sites.  The tests are convenient and are either affordable or freely available.  But how reliable are the RATs? More specifically, what is the chance that a positive result correctly predicts presence of the infection or that a negative result correctly predicts its absence?

Studies have shown that when 100 people with the infection are tested using a nasal swab RAT, about 80 will test positive [@khalid2022performance]. The same studies have shown that when 100 people without the infection are tested, about 98 will test negative.  In the language of probability, the chance of a positive test is `r sens_rat` when the virus is present,  while the chance of a negative test in the absence of the virus is `r spec_rat`.  But an individual who has just tested wants to know the reverse probabilities:  the chance they have COVID-19 when the test is positive or the chance do not have the infection when the test is negative.  The tools in  Sections [-@sec-conditional-probability] and [-@sec-bayes-rule] will show  that even though the rapid self-tests are correct 80% of the time when the virus is present, under some assumptions the chance that the virus is present in someone who has tested positive can be as low as `r ppv_rat_05 * 100`%. A positive test might be wrong nearly `r (1 - ppv_rat_05) * 100`% of the time. A negative test is more informative; the chance that the virus is absent in someone who has tested negative is 99%. 


## The rules of probability {#sec-probability-rules}

In both examples in @sec-two-examples, probability is used to quantify uncertainty about the **outcome** of a random phenomenon. These two examples differ in important ways, however.  In the first the set $S$ of all outcomes, called the **sample space**, \index{sample space} is a simple collection of 4 equally likely outcomes. Probabilities can be calculated by  counting the number of outcomes one is interested in, and dividing by the total number outcomes in the sample space. The second is more complex — it poses questions about a probability of an outcome under the condition that it has been preceded by another event — the likelihood of infection when a self-test is known to be positive - and cannot easily be solved by the direct methods of the first example.  More difficult problems need a  general definition of probability and a set of rules to guide calculations.

::: {.important data-latex=""}
**Randomness and probability.**

A phenomenon is called random if individual outcomes are uncertain but show a pattern when the phenomenon is repeated a large number of times.

The probability $p$ of an outcome in a random phenomenon is the proportion of times it would occur in a large number of replications of the phenomenon. ^[Another definition of probability is based on the subjective belief that an event will happen, that that approach is not covered in this text.]

:::

This is formalized in the Law of Large Numbers: when a random experiment is repeated many times, the observed proportion of an outcome converges to its true probability. For example, the probability of rolling a 1 on a fair six-sided die is 1/6. After many rolls, the proportion of observed 1’s will approach this value.

::: {.important data-latex=""}
**Sample spaces and events.**

The **sample space** $S$ of a random phenomenon is the set of all possible outcomes.  An **event** \index{event} $A$ is an outcome or a collection of outcomes in a random phenomenon.  It is a subset of the sample space, $S$.

:::

The  notation of set theory is used to describe events.  

* The complement $A^c$ of an event $A$ consists of all the outcomes in $S$ not in $A$.  

* Two events $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** \index{disjoint events} or **mutually exclusive** \index{mutually exclusive}  if they have no outcomes in common.  

* The event $(A \text{ and } B)$ consists of the outcomes in $S$ that are members of both $A$ and $B$, sometimes denoted as members that satisfy both $A$ and $B$.  In some texts this is written $A \cap B$.

* The event $(A \text{ or } B)$ consists of the outcomes that are either in $A$ or $B$ or possibly both. This is sometimes written $A \cup B$.    

* For conciseness, sentences such as "$B$ is the event that a child has CF" are written as $B$ = {child has CF}.

The General Social Survey is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.  The survey collects data on American society by asking respondents demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions along with some topics of special interest. It has been conducted approximately every two years since 1972. @tbl-gss-age-health shows  `r nrow(gen_ss)` total responses to two selected variables from respondents participating in surveys conducted between 2018 and 2024, classified according the age of the respondent and their perception of general health.^[The data in this and similar tables later in the text do not include missing values from non-response since methods for adjusting for missing values are beyond the scope of this text.

(c) The event $B^c$ corresponds to all the outcomes in which respondents rated their health other than good, that is, the sum of the elements in the row labeled **Sum** excluding the second column.  Alternatively, it can be calculated as the total number of respondents minus the number of respondents who rated their health as good, or `r tbl_age_health[5, 5] - tbl_age_health[5, 2]`.

(d) The number of outcomes satisfying $(A \text{ and } B)$ is the sum of the counts in rows 2, 3 and 4 of column 2, or `r tbl_age_health[2,2] + tbl_age_health[3, 2] + tbl_age_health[4, 2]`.

[^probability-3]: The event $(A^c)$ consists of all the respondents in the age group 18 to 25; there are `r tbl_age_health[1,5]` outcomes in this event.

@tbl-gss-age-health-prop displays the data from @tbl-gss-age-health but with proportions replacing counts; the proportions in each cell give the fraction of the observations in the cell when the counts have been divided by the size of the dataset, `r nrow(gen_ss)`, and can be used to calculate probabilities.  For instance, the value 0.019 in the upper left cell is the proportion of individuals age 18 to 25 and reporting excellent health, or `r tbl_age_health[1,1]` / `r tbl_age_health[5,5]`.

**Venn diagrams** \index{Venn diagrams} are often used to show visually the relationship between events in a sample space. The Venn diagram in @fig-gss-older-health-venn shows the relationship between the events $A$ and $B$ in the above example. It has less information than the full table, but provides a visual display of the overlap between $A$ and $B$.  The total possible outcomes belonging to $A$ is the sum of the 5071 members of $A$ outside $B$ and the 5844 in the intersection of the two events.  The total members of $B$ is calculated similarly.  The 417 outcomes outside the two circles represents the members of the sample space not in either event.  The percentages shown in the figure can be used to converted to proportions to calculate the probabilities of regions in the figure, so the probability of $A$ is 0.432 + 0.498 = 0.930.

**The properties of probability.**

**Probability of the sample space S:** If $S$ is the sample space of a random phenomenon, $P(S) = 1.$

**Boundedness:** The probability $P(A)$ of any event satisfies $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1.$

**Addition rule for disjoint events:**  If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events,
$$
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B).
$$
If $A_1, A_2, \ldots A_k$ are a collection of $k$ disjoint events,
$$
P(A_1 \text { or } A_2 \ldots \text{ or } A_k) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \dots + P(A_k).
$$
**Complement rule:**  For any event $A$
$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A).

:::

If no outcomes satisfy an event $A$, it cannot occur and $P(A)$ = 0. As a consequence, if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events, $P(A \text{ and } B)$ = 0.

@tbl-gss-age-health-prop illustrates the first two rules of probability: the sum of all the probabilities is 1, and the values are between 0 and 1.  


::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Using the probabilities in @tbl-gss-age-health and the rules of probability, find (a) the probability that someone chosen from this cohort rated their health as good, and (b) the probability that they rated their health as other than good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Intuitively, it is clear that the probability of being in good health is the sum of the probabilities in the second column, or 0.532 as shown in the last row.  

    More formally, summing the column is an application of the addition rule for disjoint events.  Let $D_1$ = {health rated good and age between 18 and 25}, $D_2$ = {health rated good and age between 26 and 45},  $D_3$ = {health rated good and age 56 tp 65} and $D_4$ = {health rated good and age 66+}. Then the event $B$ = {health rated good} is a combination of disjoint events:
$$
B = (D_1 \text{ or } D_2 \text{ or } D_3 \text{ or } D_4),
$$
and 
$$
P(B) = P(D_1) + P(D_2) + P(D_3) + P(D_4). 
$${#eq-prob-good-health}

    When probabilities are calculated by summing rows or columns in a table, it is generally not necessary to write out the algebra in @eq-prob-good-health since the application of the addition rule is clear.

(b) If $H$ = {other than good health}, then $H = B^c$, so 
$$
P(H) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.532 =0.477.
$$
A little less than 50% of this cohort rated their health as other than good.

    As always, it pays to be careful with the language used in a problem statement.  The phrase **other than good**  includes both excellen clear that it includes excellent and all ratings worse than good; the phrase **not good** (for instance) might be interpreted as only fair or poor.

:::

The solution to (a) used implicitly another probability rule, the rule of total probability, by breaking the event $B$ into disjoint chunks.  Here is a formal statement of the rule:

::: {.important data-latex=""}

**The rule of total probability.**

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are events in a sample space.  Then
$$ 
P(B) = P(B \text{ and } A) + P(B \text{ and } A^c).
$${#eq-total-probability}
More generally, let $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_k$ be $k$ disjoint events that cover the sample space, so $(E_1 \text{ or } E_2 \cdots \text{ or } E_k) = S$. Then 
$$
P(B) = P(B \text{ and } E_1) + P(B \text{ and } E_2) + \cdots  + P(B \text{ and } E_k).

$$
P(B) =  P(B \text{ and } A) + P(B \text{ and } A^c) = 0.12.

The prevalence of a disease is the probability that a member of a population has the disease.  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a prevalence that varies with age.  Studies have shown that in low- to upper-middle-income countries the age-related prevalence of PD is estimated to be 7 per 100,000 for individuals age 40-49, 158 per 100,000  in age 50 - 59, 603 per 100,000 in age 60 - 79, 1251 in age 70-79 and 2181 per 100,000 in age over 80.

**Probability distributions.**

A  **probability distribution** \index{probability distribution} consists of all disjoint outcomes and their associated probabilities that satisfies the three rules:

* The outcomes listed must be disjoint.

* Each probability must be between 0 and 1.

* The probabilities must total to 1.

: Probability distribution for the sum of two dice {#tbl-sum-two-dice} 

  It is important to note that the 11  outcomes for the sum of the two dice are not equally likely.  

(b) @fig-sum-two-dice is a bar graph in which the height of each bar is the probability of the corresponding value of the sum.  The graph has the same appearance as a bar graph showing the relative frequency of a variable, such as the carapace colors in @fig-crabs-counts-proportions, but there is an important distinction between the twp graphs. @fig-crabs-counts-proportions shows the distribution of data collected as part of a completed study; @fig-sum-two-dice shows a theoretical probability distribution for the sum of two dice before any data has been collected.

The proportions in @tbl-gss-deg-work-prop also comprise a probability distribution, but one that cannot easily be put into a bar chart.

Suppose now as in the example with age and health status, $B$ = {health rating good} and $E$ = {respondent is age 26 - 45}.  The probability $P(B \text{ and } E)$ is the value in @tbl-gss-age-health-prop in the intersection of the shaded second row, and second column shown in @tbl-gss-age-health-prop-shaded, or `r tbl_age_health_prop[2,2]`.  What about $P(B \text{ or }E)$? The events $B$ and $E$ are not disjoint so the addition rule for disjoint events does not apply.  Adding together the sum of second row and second column (`r  tbl_age_health_prop[2,5] + tbl_age_health_prop[5,2]`) includes the proportion for {age 26-45 and health rating good} twice, so it must be subtracted once:
\begin{align*}
P(B \text{ or } E) &= P(B) + P(E) - P(B \text{ and } E) \\
    &= `r tbl_age_health_prop[2,5]` + `r tbl_age_health_prop[5,2]` - `r tbl_age_health_prop[2,2]` \\
    &= `r tbl_age_health_prop[2,5] + tbl_age_health_prop[5,2] - tbl_age_health_prop[2,2]`.

The calculation of $P(B \text{ or } E)$ illustrates to the General Addition Rule for Probabilities:

::: {.important data-latex=""}
**General addition rule for probabilities.**

If $A$ and $B$ are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability that at least one of them will occur is
$$
P(A\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\text{ and } B),
$$ {#eq-general-addition-rule}
where $P(A \text{ and } B)$ is the probability that both events occur.

:::

```{r}
terms_chp_3 <- c(terms_chp_3, c("general addition rule of probability")

```


The idea behind the general addition rule can be visualized in the Venn diagram in  @fig-gss-age-health-venn showing the relationship between the events {age 26 to 45} and {health rating good}.  The figure shows that there are 1896 + 2180 = 4076 outcomes in the event {age 26 to 45} and 4066 + 2180 = 6246  in the event {health rating good}.  Adding the two total outcomes 4076 + 6246 = 10322 double counts the 2180 in the overlap, so the number of outcomes in ({age 26 to 45} or {health rating good}) is 4076 + 6246 - 2180 = 8146.

## Conditional probability {#sec-conditional-probability}


In 2024, The US CDC estimated that 11.3% of the US adult population had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and another 4.5% were living with undiagnosed diabetes^[Defined as the survey respondent reporting never having received a diabetes diagnosis from a healthcare provider but experiencing 8 to 24 hour fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 6.5% from tests done with the respondent] [@gwira2024diabetes].  Epidemiologists label these proportions the \index{prevalence} **prevalence** of diabetes.  If the patients seen at a clinic are representative of the US population (a very strong assumption, indeed!) then the chance is between 4 and 5% that a health care provider will detect diabetes in an adult patient without a prior diagnosis. But this probability only applies if nothing else is known about the patient. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies with age, for instance.  If the provider knows the patient is between 20 and 39 years old,  how should they revise that chance of undiagnosed diabetes?

@tbl-age-diabetes-prevalence shows the prevalence of diabetes status for the three age groups 20 - 39, 40 - 59 and age 60 or older, and is based on data from the [US CDC November 2024 Data Brief](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db516.htm). For instance, among members of the US population age 20 - 39, the proportions of members with diagnosed, undiagnosed  or no diabetes are 0.022, 0.013 and 0.964, respectively.  The chance that a patient between 20 and 39 has undiagnosed diabetes (0.013) is less than 1/3 that of randomly selected adult (0.045).  

| Age Group | Diagnosed | Undiagnosed | No Diabetes |
|-----------|----------:|------------:|------------:|
| 20–39     |     0.022 |       0.013 |       0.964 |
| 40–59     |     0.121 |       0.056 |       0.823 |
| $≥$ 60    |     0.205 |       0.068 |       0.727 |

: Type 2 diabetes status by age {#tbl-age-diabetes-prevalence} {tbl-colwidths="[25,25,25,25]"}



Suppose  $B$ is the event that a randomly selected member of the US adult population has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.  According to the CDC data, $P(B)$ =  0.113, or 11.3%. @tbl-age-diabetes-prevalence shows that if one adds the condition that the adult is between 20 and 39, that probability decreases to 0.022. The probability  has changed because, instead of sampling from the entire adult population, the random selection is from a reduced sample space, adults between 20 and 39 years old. In the language of probability, 0.022 is the \index{conditional probability} **conditional probability** that an individual has been diagnosed with diabetes, given that (or conditioning on) the person between 20 and 39 years old.   

Suppose $A$ is the event that a randomly selected individual between 20 and 39 years old.  In the notation of conditional probability $P(B | A)$ = 0.022.


::: {.important data-latex=""}
**Conditional probability.**

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events.  The conditional probability of $B$ given $A$, written $P(B | A)$, is the probability of $B$ occurring if it is known that $A$ has occurred.

In the example of rolling two dice in @sec-probability-rules, let $A$ ={the sum of the dice is 4} and $B$ = {the outcome of the roll was (2, 2)}.  What are (a) 
$P(B | A)$ and $P(A | B)$?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) @tbl-sum-two-dice shows that if the sum is 4, the outcome of the roll must have been one of the ordered pairs (1, 3), (2, 2), or (3, 1). In this reduced sample space of 3 outcomes, they are equally likely so each of will have occurred occurred with probability 1/3 and $P(B|A) = 1/3$. 

(b) If it is known that the roll yielded (2, 2), then the sum must be 4, so $P(A|B) = 1.$  This is not a particularly practical example but it emphasizes that  $P(B|A)$ and $P(A|B)$ can be very different.
:::

Conditional probabilities can be calculated from tables such as @tbl-gss-age-health.  Suppose $A$ = {age 26 to 45}.  Conditioning on the event $A$ = {age 26 to 45} means calculating probabilities for reported health among the `r tbl_age_health[2,5]` respondents in that age group.  Conditional probabilities for a reported health rating will be the proportion of the observed outcomes among the number of respondents between 26 and 46. 

Conditioning on any other age group involves calculating proportions for outcomes in that age group.  These conditional probabilities will be the row proportions in a table based @tbl-gss-age-health, but with counts replaced by row proportions.  The  modified table is shown in @tbl-gss-age-health-row-prop.

Since conditional probabilities are simply probabilities recalculated in a reduced sample space, they satisfy the 4 properties of probability in @sec-probability-rules. 

@tbl-gss-age-health-prop and @tbl-gss-age-health-row-prop appear similar, but the values in the two tables correspond to different types of probabilities.  In @tbl-gss-age-health-prop the value in the second row, second column (`r tbl_age_health_prop[2,2]`) is $P$({age 26 to 45} and {health rating good}).  It is the proportion of respondents who fell simultaneously into that age and health status among all `r tbl_age_health[5,5]` respondents and is called a \index{joint probability} **joint probability** for the two outcomes. In @tbl-gss-age-health-row-prop the value in the second row, second column  is a **conditional probability**, the proportion of respondents rating their health good when restricted to (conditioned on) those in age group 26 to 45.  In @tbl-gss-age-health-prop the row sums in the last column show the probability of an age group among the respondents, regardless of health status; the column sums in the last row show the probabilities of health rating, regardless of age.  These probabilities are called **marginal probabilities** \index{marginal probability} for health rating and age.

This terminology is summarized in the following box:

::: {.important data-latex=""}
**Joint, conditional and marginal probabilities.**

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events in a sample space.  The joint probability of $A$ and $B$, $P(A \text{ and } B)$ is the probability that both will occur simultaneously. The conditional probability $P(B \mid A)$ is the probability of $B$ under the condition that $A$ is known to have occurred.  The marginal probability $P(B)$ is the probability that $B$ will occur without regard to whether $A$ has occurred, and similarly for $P(A)$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $A$ = {an individual has COVID-19} and $B$ = {the individual tests positive for the infection.}  The statement that of 100 individuals with the infection 80 will test positive is the conditional probability $P(B | A)$ = 0.80. The statement that when 100 people without the disease are tested, 98 will test negative is the conditional probability  $P(B^c | A^c)$ = 0.98.  The relevant conditional probabilities for an individual who has just tested are instead $P(A | B)$ and $P(A^c | B^c)$.  The introduction claims that under some assumptions, $P(A | B)$ = 0.20, while $P(A^c | B^c) \approx$ 1.0, so $P(A | B)$ is very different from $P(B | A)$.   

There are no marginal or joint probabilities: $P(A)$, the prevalence of COVID-19, $P(B)$, the prevalence of positive tests, and the joint probabilities $P(A \text{ and } B)$ or $P(A^c \text{ and } B^c)$ someone has the disease and tests positive or has the disease and tests negative.

Tables such as @tbl-gss-age-health-row-prop provide convenient summaries of conditional probabilities that depend on categorical variables.  The conditional probability for any reported health rating, given a respondent is age 66+ (for instance), can be read from the last row of the table, and the comparing the rows of the table shows how the conditional probabilities of health rating vary with age. In @sec-relationships-two-categorical tables with row proportions were used to explore the relationship between two categorical variables in the World Values Survey (e.g., @tbl-wvs-edu-health-row-prop).   Instead of showing a relationship in collected data, however, @tbl-gss-age-health-row-prop shows how probabilities vary across levels of a categorical variable.


The calculations of a row proportion suggests a formula for calculating conditional probabilities.  Suppose, for example, $A$ = {age 26 to 45} and  $B$ = {Health rating good}. The element in @tbl-gss-age-health-row-prop corresponding the $P(B \mid A)$ is  

\begin{aligned}
P(B \mid A)

In the problem statement $P(F \text{ and } A)$ = 0.074, $P(F^c \text{ and } A)$ = 0.044, and $P(F)$ = 0.505. Part (a) asks for the Venn diagram showing the relationship between $A$ and $F$. Parts (b) and (c) ask for $P(A \mid F)$ and $P(F \mid A)$, respectively, while (d) asks for an explanation of the conditional probabilities that does not use the jargon of probability.

(a) It is best to begin by sketching the main features of a Venn diagram before calculating the probabilities of events. The  @fig-female-80plus-venn-blank shows an initial Venn diagram, emphasizing the relationship between the events but without the probabilities.  Since $P(F \text{ and } A) > 0$, there will be an overlap between the events, as shown in the diagram.  The white space surrounding the diagram represents individuals who are neither females or in the 80+ group (males who are less than 80 years old.)

(b) The conditional probability that a randomly sampled female is 80+ is the conditional probability of being in that age group, given that the sampled person is female, $P(A \mid F)$.  
\begin{align*}

(d)  Part (b): Approximately 15% of the females in the US are at least 80 years old.  Part (c): Among the elders in the US who are at least 80 years old, approximately 63% are female.  So a majority of people in the US at least 80 years old are female.  Women do indeed live longer than men.

Suppose that among male adults between 25 and 40 years of age, hypertension occurs about 18% of the time. For simplicity assume that the population is 50% male, 50% female. What is the probability of randomly selecting a male with hypertension from the population of individuals 25-40 years of age?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let $A$ be the event that a person has hypertension, and $B$ the event that they are a male adult between 25 and 40 years of age. $P(A|B)$, the probability of hypertension given male sex, is 0.18. Thus, $P(A \text{ and } B) = (0.18)(0.50) = 0.09$.
:::

The conditional probability $P(B \mid A)$ quantifies how knowing that $A$ has occurred changes the chance of $B$ happening.  When $P(B)$ and $P(B \mid A)$ are the same, knowing that $A$ has occurred provides no information about the chance of $B$.  In that case, $A$ and $B$ are called **statistically independent** \index{independent}.

**Independent events.**

Two events $A$ and $B$ in a  sample space are independent when 
$$
  P(B \mid A) = P(B).

Applying the multiplication rule to two independent events $A$ and $B$ yields an alternative definition for independent events:
$$
 P(B\text{ and } A) = P(B \mid A)P(A) = P(B)P(A).
$${#eq-two-independent-events}

$$
P(A_1) P(A_2) \cdots P(A_k).

---------------------------------------

Let $B$ represent blood group O, and $A$ represent Asian ethnicity. Since $P(B|A) = 0.40$ does not equal $P(B) = 0.45$, the two events are not independent.   Alternatively, 
\begin{align*}
P(A \text{ and } B) &= P(B |A)P(A) \\
    &= (0.40)(0.04) \\

[^probability-301]: $A$ and $B$ are not independent since $P(B)$ = 1/12 (approximately) but $P(B|A) = 0,$ since a day in October cannot be a day in summer.  The two events are disjoint, however, since both $A$ and $B$ cannot happen simultaneously.

Mandatory drug testing in the workplace is common practice for certain professions, such as air traffic controllers and transportation workers.  A false positive in a drug screening test occurs when the test incorrectly indicates that a screened person is an illegal drug user. Suppose a mandatory drug test has a false positive rate of 1.2% (i.e., has probability  0.012 of indicating that an employee is using illegal drugs when that is not the case).  Given 150 employees who are in reality drug free, what is the probability that at least one will falsely test positive? Assume that the outcome of one drug test has no effect on the others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, note that the complement of at least 1 person testing positive is that no one tests positive (i.e., all employees test negative). The multiplication rule can then be used to calculate the \begin{align*}
P(\text{At least 1 } \texttt{+}) 
  &= P(\text{1 or 2 or 3 } \cdots \text{ or 150 are } \texttt{+}) \\
  &= 1 - P(\text{None are } \texttt{+}) \\
  &= 1 - P(\text{150 are } \texttt{-}) \\
  &= 1 - P(\texttt{-})^{150} \\
  &= 1 - (0.988)^{150} \\
  &= 1 - 0.16 \\
  &= 0.84.
\end{align*}
 Even when using a test with a small probability of a false positive, the company is more than 80\% likely to incorrectly claim at least one employee is an illegal drug user!

:::

::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=""}

Because of the high likelihood of at least one false positive in company wide drug screening programs, an individual with a positive test is always re-tested with a different screening test: one that is more expensive than the first, but has a lower false positive probability. Suppose the second test has a false positive rate of 0.8%.  What is the probability that an employee who is not using illegal drugs will test positive on both tests? [^probability-303]
:::

[^probability-303]: The outcomes of the two tests are independent of one another; $P (A\text{ and } B) = P(A) P(B)$, where events $A$ and $B$ are the results of the two tests. The probability of a false positive with the first test is 0.012 and 0.008 with the second. Thus, the probability of an employee who is not using illegal drugs testing positive on both tests is $(0.012) (0.008) = (9.6) 10^{-5}.$

**ABO blood groups** There are four different common blood types (A, B, AB, and O) that are are determined by the presence of certain antigens located on cell surfaces. Antigens are substances used by the immune system to recognize self versus non-self; if the immune system encounters antigens not normally found on the body's own cells, it will attack the foreign cells. When patients receive blood transfusions, it is critical that the antigens of transfused cells match those of the patient's, or else an immune system response will be triggered.

The ABO blood group system consists of four different blood groups, which describe whether an individual's red blood cells carry the A antigen, B antigen, both, or neither. The ABO gene has three alleles: ${I}^{A}$, ${I}^{B}$, and *i*. The *i* allele is recessive to both ${I}^{A}$ and ${I}^{B}$, and does not produce antigens; thus, an individual with genotype ${I}^{A}i$ is blood group A and an individual with genotype ${I}^{B}i$ is blood group B. The ${I}^{A}$ and ${I}^{B}$ alleles are codominant, such that individuals of ${I}^{A}$${I}^{B}$ genotype are AB. Individuals who inherit two copies of the \textit{i} allele are known as blood group O, with neither A nor B antigens. @fig-abo-inheritance shows graphically how inheritance determines blood group.

Suppose that both members of a couple have Group AB blood.	(a) What is the probability that a child of this couple will have Group A blood? (b) What is the probability that they have two children with Group A blood?


------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) An individual with Group AB blood is genotype ${I}^{A}$${I}^{B}$. Two ${I}^{A}$${I}^{B}$ parents can produce children with genotypes ${I}^{A}$${I}^{B}$, ${I}^{A}$${I}^{A}$, or ${I}^{B}$${I}^{B}$. Of these possibilities, only children with genotype ${I}^{A}$${I}^{A}$ have Group A blood. Each parent has 0.5 probability of passing down their ${I}^{A}$ allele. Thus, the probability that a child of this couple will have Group A blood is P(parent 1 passes down ${I}^{A}$ allele) $\times$ P(parent 2 passes down ${I}^{A}$ allele) = $(0.5)(0.5) = 0.25$.

  (b) Inheritance of alleles is independent between children. Thus, the probability of two children having Group A blood equals P(child 1 has Group A blood) $\times$ P(child 2 has group A blood). The probability of a child of this couple having Group A blood was previously calculated as 0.25, so the answer is $(0.25)(0.25) = 0.0625$.

## Bayes' Rule {#sec-bayes-rule}

@sec-two-examples opened this chapter with a question about the likelihood of a COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) correctly predicting the presence of the virus.  Let {COVID-19} denote the event that someone has the virus and {RAT^+^} denote a positive self-test. Suppose, as in @sec-two-examples, the probability of a positive test in a person with the virus is 0.80 (80%). In the language of conditional probability, 
$$
P(\text{RAT}^+ \mid \text{COVID-19}) = 0.80.
$${#eq-rat-sensitivity}

The likelihood of a positive test correctly predicting the presence of the virus is the reverse conditional probability:
$$
P(\text{COVID-19} \mid \text{RAT}^+).
$${#eq-rat-ppv}

From earlier examples, it is clear that it would be wrong to assume these two conditional probabilities are equal.

The solution to this problem is an important application of probability to diagnostic medicine.  In clinical care settings, diagnostic tests that return positive or negative values (disease present or absent) are frequently used to screen for  underlying conditions. ^[@Mukherjee2025EarlyDetection provides an interesting and readable account of current issues in screening for cancer.]

Specific terminology is used to describe behavior of diagnostic tests.  Suppose $D$ denotes the presence of a disease and $D^C$ its absence.  Let $T^+$ and $T^-$ denote the events of a positive and negative diagnostic test, respectively.

* The **prevalence** of a disease $D$ is the proportion of individuals in a population with the disease.  It is the probability that a randomly chosen member of a population has the disease and is denoted by $P(D)$.

* The **sensitivity** \index{sensitivity} of $T$ is the conditional probability $P(T^+ \mid D)$.  If someone has the disease, how often is the test positive?  Sensitivity is also called the probability of a true positive for the test.

* The **specificity** \index{specificity} of $T$ is the conditional probability $P(T-\mid D^C)$. If someone does not have the disease,  how often is the test negative?  Specificity is the probability of a true negative.

* The the **positive predictive value (PPV)** \index{positive predictive value} of the test $T$ is the conditional probability $P(D \mid T^+)$.  If a test is positive, how often is the disease present?

* The **negative predictive value (NPV)** \index{negative predictive value} of $T$ is the conditional probability $P(D^C \mid T^-)$.  If $T$ is negative, how often is the disease truly absent?

@eq-rat-sensitivity posits a sensitivity for a RAT, while @eq-rat-ppv is its positive predictive value.   How does the PPV of a test depend on its sensitivity?  This section discusses three approaches to calculating the PPV of a test: the use of tree diagrams, an application of Bayes' Rule,  and the construction of a hypothetical population where a 2$\times$2 table can be used to calculate conditional probabilities from counts, as in @sec-conditional-probability.  

In addition to the sensitivity of a diagnostic test, all three methods depend on the specificity of the test (the probability of a true negative) and the prevalence of the disease. For the COVID-19 example,  the calculations assume $P(\text{RAT}^- \mid \text{COVID-19}^C)$ = 0.98, the probability of a true negative cited in @sec-two-examples. The prevalence of COVID-19 changes seasonally and among regions.  Initially the solution provided here assumes the infection is present in 5% of a population, so $P(D)$ = 0.05.  But it is important to examine how the PPV changes with prevalence, and that is explored later. 

**Tree diagrams**

A **tree diagram** \index{tree diagram} is especially useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence, with the conditional probability of each outcome depending the preceding outcomes.  The tree provides a scheme for computing joint probabilities.

```{r}
# ppv for covid RAT
# also used and repeated later
# 

sens_rat <- 0.80
spec_rat <- 0.98
prev_covid <- 0.05
```

In @fig-rat-tree, the first branches (called the primary branches) of the tree split the population by COVID-19 status, and show the marginal probabilities 0.05 and 0.95 of having or not having the infection. The secondary branches show conditional probabilities determined by the primary branches; for example, the top branch is the conditional probability of a positive RAT given that an individual has the infection. The secondary branch below it shows the conditional probability of a negative test, given the disease is present.  A negative test when the disease is present is the complement of a positive test and has probability 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.  The values along the other branches are calculated similarly.

```{r rat-tree}
#| label: fig-rat-tree
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-cap: | 
#|     Tree diagram for the behavior of COVID-19 self-tests (RATs)
treeDiag(c('COVID-19', 'RAT Self test'),
         c(0.05, 0.95),
         list(c(0.80, 0.20),
              c(0.02, 0.98)),
         textwd = 0.2,
         solwd = 0.35,
         cex.main = 1.4,
         c('present', 'absent'),
         c('positive','negative'),
         digits = 5,
         col.main = COL[1],
         showWork = TRUE)
```


Joint probabilities are calculated at the end of each branch by multiplying the numbers from right to left, using the Multiplication Rule for Probabilities, @eq-mult-rule-two-probs. For instance, the probability of having the infection and testing positive is the conditional probability of testing positive given COVID-19 is present times the probability COVID-19 is present:

\begin{align*}
P(\text{COVID-19 and RAT$^+$}) &= P(\text{RAT$^+$ } |\ \text{COVID-19}) \times  P(\text{COVID-19}) \\
	&= (0.80) (0.05) \\ 
	&= 0.04.
\end{align*}

The rest of the joint probabilities are calculated the same way.

The tree diagram can be used to calculate the PPV of a RAT, 
$$
P(\text{COVID-19} \mid \text{RAT}^+) = \frac{P(\text{COVID-19 and RAT}^+)}
{P(\text{RAT}^+)}. 
$$

The numerator is the probability of the top branch, 0.04.  The denominator is the sum of the probabilities along the two branches that lead to a positive RAT: either a true positive when having COVID-19, 0.04, or a false positive in the absence of the infection, 0.019.  So $P(\text{RAT}+)$ = 0.059. The PPV is the ratio 0.04/0.059 = 0.678.  With a positive self-test, the chance of COVID-19 is 68% under the assumption that the prevalence of the infection is 5%.


```{r}
# ppv for covid RAT
# also used and repeated later
# 

sens_rat <- 0.80
spec_rat <- 0.98
prev_covid_03 <- 0.03


ppv_rat_03 <- round((sens_rat * prev_covid_03)/(sens_rat * prev_covid_03 + (1 - spec_rat) * (1 - prev_covid_03)), 2)
npv_rat_03 <- round(spec_rat * (1 - prev_covid_03) /(spec_rat * 1 - prev_covid_03 + (1 - sens_rat) * prev_covid_03), 2)

prev_covid_08 <- 0.08
ppv_rat_08 <- round((sens_rat * prev_covid_08)/(sens_rat * prev_covid_08 + (1 - spec_rat) * (1 - prev_covid_08)), 2)
npv_rat_08 <- round(spec_rat * (1 - prev_covid_08) /(spec_rat * 1 - prev_covid_08 + (1 - sens_rat) * prev_covid_08), 2)
```


::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Under the assumptions above, use the tree diagram to calculate the negative predictive value (NPV) of a COVID-19 self-test.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NPV is 
$$
P(\text{COVID-19}^C) \mid \text{RAT}^-) = \frac{P(\text{COVID-19}^C \text{ and RAT}^-)}
{P(\text{RAT}^-)}.
$$  
The numerator is the value at the end of the lowest branch, 0.931.  The denominator is sum of the values on the two branches that lead to a negative test, 0.01 + 0.931 = 0.941.  The PPV is 0.931/0.941 = 0.989.  Under the assumptions used here, the chance that the infection is absent when a test is negative is 99%. 
:::

The PPV and NPV for COVID-19 self-tests calculated here match those claimed in @sec-two-examples but depend on the assumptions made about the test and the setting in which it is administered.  The sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of the test itself and do not change unless the technology of the test changes.  But the prevalence depends on the population using the test and may change with time or location.

::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

(a)  What is the PPV of RAT if all of the characteristics of the test remain the same but the prevalence of COVID-19 is 0.03 instead of 0.05? 
(b)  What is the PPV if the prevalence is 0.08 instead of 0.05?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. If the prevalence decreases from 0.05 to 0.03, the probability of the top branch will be (0.03)(0.80) = 0.24. The probability of a positive RAT will be (0.03)(0.80) + (0.97)(0.98) = 0.975.  The PPV will be 0.24/0.975 = 0.246.  The chance of COVID-19 is only 25% when a self-test is positive but the prevalence of the infection is 3%.

b. When the prevalence is 0.08 (8%), the 
\begin{align*} 
\text{PPV}  &= \frac{(0.08)(0.80)} {(0.08)(0.80) + (0.92)(0.02)} \\
&= 0.777
\end{align*}
The chance of COVID-19 after a positive test increases to 78% when the prevalence of the infection is 8% instead of 5%.

The chance you have COVID-19 after a positive test depends on how many people around you are infected as well as the quality of the test.  The reasons for this will be explored later.

Then chance of a positive test is rarely specified in advance, but can be calculated using the characteristics of the test and the prevalence of $D$:
\begin{align*}
P(T^+) &= P(T^+ \text{ and } D) + P(T^+ \text{ and } D^C) \\
       &= P(T^+ \mid D)P(D) + P(T^+ \mid D^C)P(D^C) \\
\end{align*}
The first line uses the Rule of Total Probability (@eq-total-probability) and the second the Multiplication Rule (@eq-mult-rule-two-probs).

Using this expression for the denominator in @eq-bayes-testing,  
$$
\text{PPV} = \frac{P(T^+ \mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+ \mid D)P(D) + P(T^+ \mid D^C)P(D^C)}.
$${#eq-bayes-testing-expanded}

@eq-bayes-testing-expanded leads to a useful mnemonic often used in medicine and public health for the PPV of diagnostic test:

$$
\text{PPV} = \frac{\text{sensitivity } \times \text{ prevalence}}{[\text{sensitivity } \times \text{ prevalence}] + [\text{(1 - specificity) } \times \text{ (1 - prevalence)}]}.
$${#eq-bayes-ppv-mnemonic}

The negative predictive value (NPV) of a diagnostic test is the conditional probability $P(D^C \mid T^-)$.  Bayes' Rule can be used to show
$$
\text{NPV} = \frac{\text{specificity } \times (\text{1 - prevalence})}{[(\text{1 - sensitivity}) \times \text{ prevalence}] + [\text{specificity } \times \text{ (1 - prevalence)}]}.
$${#eq-bayes-npv-mnemonic}

These are not formulas to memorize -- it would be too easy to get them confused.  But they are useful they have been recorded.

Some congenital disorders are caused by errors that occur during cell division, resulting in the presence of additional chromosome copies. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) occurs in approximately 1 out of 800 births. Cell-free fetal DNA (cfDNA) testing is one commonly used way to screen fetuses for trisomy 21. The test sensitivity is 0.98 and the specificity is 0.995. Calculate the PPV and NPV of the test. [^probability-440]

If your were counseling parents whose fetus will be tested for Trisomy 21 using cfDNA, what would you tell them in advance about interpreting the outcome of the test, without using any of the jargon from probability?
[^probability-441]
:::

[^probability-441]: Here is one possible script: Since you have no special risk factors for Down syndrome in an infant,  your overall chance of having an affected infant is about 1/800, approximately one tenth of 1%. The test we use to screen for the congenital mutation is the best we have, but it is not perfect. If the test is negative (sugggesting the mutation is not present) there is a 99.5% chance that your infant will not be affected.  If it is positive, then there is about a 20% chance the mutation is present.  So a negative test would be very good news.  A positive test is not necessarily bad news: it will suggest that the chance is about 1 in 5 that your infant will be affected.  Do you have any questions?

@eq-bayes-testing-expanded is a specific example of more general versions of Bayes' rule:

::: {.important data-latex=""}
**Bayes' rule, full version.**

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are events in a sample space.  Then
$$
  P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B) P(B)}{P(A \mid B) P(B) + P(A \mid B^C) P(B^C)}.
$${#eq-bayes-trad}
More generally suppose that $B = (B_1 \text{ and } B_2  \cdots \text{ and } B_k)$, where the events $B_1, B_2, \cdots, B_k$ are disjoint.  Then 

$$
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A | B_1) P(B_1)}
	{P(A | B_1) P(B_1) + P(A | B_2) P(B_2) + \cdots + P(A | B_k) P(B_k)}.

```

The positive predictive value (PPV) of a diagnostic test can be calculated by constructing a 2 $\times$ 2contingency table for a large, hypothetical population and calculating conditional probabilities by conditioning on rows or columns. Using a large enough hypothetical population results in an empirical estimate of PPV that is very close to the exact value obtained via using the previously discussed approaches.

The method begins by constructing an empty $2 \times 2$ table, with the possible outcomes of the diagnostic test as the rows, and the possible disease statuses as the columns as in @tbl-rat-setup. The table should include cells for the row and column sums.


|               | COVID-19 Present | COVID-19 Absent  | Sum     |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| RAT Positive | --                | --               | --      |

| Sum          | --                | --               | 100,000 |

: A 2 \times 2 table for the COVID RAT test example with a hypothetical population size $N$ of 100,000 {#tbl-rat-setup} 

Continue populating the table with the following steps, using the information in @fig-rat-tree:

* An assumed prevalence of 5%

* An 80% chance of a true positive and 20% of a false negative

* A 98% chance of a true negative and 2% of a false positive

1.  Calculate the two column totals (the number of individuals with and without COVID-19) from $P(\text{COVID-19})$, the infection prevalence:
	$$N \times P(\text{COVID-19}) = 100,000 \times .05 = 5,000 \text{ individuals with COVID-19}.$$
	$$N \times [1 - P(\text{COVID-19})] = 100,000 \times [1 - 0.05] = 95,000 \text{ individuals without COVID-19}.$$
	
	Alternatively, the number of individuals without COVID-19 can be calculated by subtracting the number with COVID-19 from $N$.
	
2. Calculate the two numbers in the first column: the number of individuals with COVID-19 testing either positive (true positive) or negative (false negative).
	$$\text{COVID-19 infected} \times P(\text{true positive}) = 5,000 \times 0.80 = 4,000 \text{ true positives}$$
	$$\text{COVID-19 infected} \times P(\text{false negative}) = 5,000 \times 0.20 = 1,000 \text{ false negatives}$$
	
3. Calculate the two numbers in the second column: the number of individuals without the infection testing either positive (false positive) or negative (true negative). 
	$$\text{COVID-19 uninfected} \times P(\text{false positive}) = 95,000 \times 0.02 = 1,900 \text{ false positives}$$
	$$\text{COVID-19 uninfected} \times P(\text{true negative})] = 95,000 \times 0.98 = 93,100 \text{ true negatives}$$
	
4.  Complete the table by calculating the two row totals: the number of positive and negative mammograms out of 100,000.
	$$(\text{true positives}) + (\text{ false positives}) = 4,000 + 1,900 = 5,900 \text{ positives}$$
	$$(\text{true negatives}) + (\text{false negatives}) = 93,100 + 1,000 = 94,100 \text{ negatives}$$
	
5.  Finally, calculate the PPV of the RAT test using the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of positive tests. This estimate is more than accurate enough, with the estimated value matching the exact calculation up to the third decimal place. 
	
	$$\frac{\text{ true positive tests}}{\text{ positive tests}} = \frac{`r t_pos_05`}{`r tot_pos_05`} = `r ppv_05`. $$

@tbl-rat-complete and the calculations to fill in the cells provide a more concrete interpretation of PPV.  The positive predictive value of a diagnostic test is the fraction of the number of instances of a true positive test out of all tests that would be positive, including the false positive outcomes.  If you are a member of the subset of the population testing positive, how likely is it that you have a true positive?  This interpretation can be used to explore the effect prevalence on PPV.

```{r}
# code for contingency tables

prev_ct_01 <- 0.01
sens_ct <- 0.80
spec_ct <- 0.98
N_ct <- 100000

covid_cases_01 <- prev_ct_01 * N_ct 
covid_absent_01 <- N_ct - covid_cases_01
t_pos_01 <- covid_cases_01 * sens_ct
f_neg_01 <- covid_cases_01 * (1 - sens_ct)
t_neg_01 <- covid_absent_01 * spec_ct

tot_neg_01 <- t_neg_01 + f_neg_01

ppv_01 <- round(t_pos_01 / tot_pos_01, 3)


```

@tbl-rat-complete-01 shows the behavior of a RAT if the COVID-19 prevalence is 0.01 instead of 0.05.  The values in the cells are calculated using the earlier formulas.

: A 2 $\times$ 2 table for the COVID RAT test example with a hypothetical population size $N$ of 100,000 and COVID-19 prevalence 1% {#tbl-rat-complete-01} 

The PPV is now `r ppv_01`.  The reduced prevalence causes fewer true positive results, `r t_pos_01` versus `r t_pos_05`, and because of the larger number of individuals without the infection, an increased number of false positives, `r f_pos_01` versus `r f_pos_05`.  The ratio of true positives to total positives decreases.

The dependence of PPV on prevalence causes a conundrum in for screening populations for a rare disease -- there will be a large proportion of false positives.  That is especially important when a positive diagnostic test might be followed by a more invasive procedure.

## Extended example: cat genetics {#sec-cat-genetics}

So far, the principles of probability have been illustrated with relatively short examples. In a more complex setting, it can be surprisingly difficult to translate a problem scenario into the language of probability. This section demonstrates how the rules of probability can be applied to work through a relatively sophisticated conditioning problem.

**Problem statement**

The gene that controls white coat color in cats, $KIT$, is responsible for multiple phenotypes such as deafness and blue eye color. A dominant allele $W$ at one location in the gene has complete **penetrance** \index{penetrance} for white coat color; all cats with the $W$ allele have white coats. There is incomplete penetrance for blue eyes and deafness; not all white cats will have blue eyes and not all white cats will be deaf. However, deafness and blue eye color are strongly linked, such that white cats with blue eyes are much more likely to be deaf. The variation in penetrance for eye color and deafness may be due to other genes as well as environmental factors.

Suppose that 30% of white cats have one blue eye, while 10% of white cats have two blue eyes. About 73% of white cats with two blue eyes are deaf and 40% of white cats with one blue eye are deaf. Only 19% of white cats with other eye colors are deaf.

a. Calculate the prevalence of deafness among white cats.
	
b. Given that a white cat is deaf, what is the probability that it has two blue eyes?
	
c.  Suppose that deaf, white cats have an increased chance of being blind, but that the prevalence of blindness differs according to eye color. While deaf, white cats with two blue eyes or two non-blue eyes have probability 0.20 of developing blindness, deaf and white cats with one blue eye have probability 0.40 of developing blindness. White cats that are not deaf have probability 0.10 of developing blindness, regardless of their eye color.
	
    i. What is the prevalence of blindness among deaf, white cats?
		
    ii. What is the prevalence of blindness among white cats?
		
    iii. Given that a cat is white and blind, what is the probability that it has two blue eyes?
    
```{r}
terms_chp_3 <- c(terms_chp_3, c("penetrance")
                )
```

	
**Establishing notation**

Before beginning any calculations, it is essential to clearly define any notation that will be used. For this problem, there are several events of interest: deafness, number of blue eyes (either 0, 1, or 2), and blindness. 

* Let $D$ represent the event that a white cat is deaf.

* Let $B_0$ = {zero blue eyes}, $B_1$ = {one blue eye}, and $B_2$ = {two blue eyes}.

* Let $L$ represent the event that a white cat is blind.


Since all cats mentioned in the problem are white, it is not necessary to define whiteness as an event; white cats represent the sample space.

**Part a, deafness**

The prevalence of deafness among white cats is the proportion of white cats that are deaf; i.e., the probability of deafness among white cats. This is the value of $P(D)$.

::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Using the notation above, rewrite the following information from the problem statement:

> Suppose that 30% of white cats have one blue eye, while 10% of white cats have two blue eyes. About 73% of white cats with two blue eyes are deaf and 40\% of white cats with one blue eye are deaf. Only 19% of white cats with other eye colors are deaf.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first sentence provides information about the prevalence of white cats with one blue eye and white cats with two blue eyes: $P(B_1) = 0.30$ and $P(B_2) = 0.10$. The only other possible eye color combination is zero blue eyes (i.e., two non-blue eyes); i.e., since $P(B_0) + P(B_1) + P(B_2) = 1$, $P(B_0) = 1  - P(B_1) - P(B_2) = 0.60$. Sixty percent of white cats have two non-blue eyes.

While it is not difficult to recognize that the second and third sentences provide information about deafness in relation to eye color, it can be easy to miss that these probabilities are conditional probabilities. A close reading should focus on the language: "About 73% *of* white cats with two blue eyes are deaf...": i.e., out of the white cats that have two blue eyes, 73% are deaf. Thus, these are probabilities of deafness conditioned on eye color. From these sentences, $P(D|B_2) = 0.73$, $P(D|B_1) = 0.40$, and $P(D|B_0) = 0.19$. 

:::

There are three possible ways to partition the event $D$ that a white cat is deaf: a cat could be deaf and have two blue eyes, be deaf and have one blue eye (and one non-blue eye), or be deaf and have two non-blue eyes. Thus, by the Addition Rule of Disjoint Events: 
$$
P(D) = P(D \text{ and } B_2 ) + P(D \text{ and } B_1 ) + P(D \text{ and } B_0 ).
$$

Although the joint probabilities of being deaf and having particular eye colors are not given in the problem, these can be calculated using the Multiplication Rule, @eq-mult-rule-two-probs:

\begin{align*}
P(D) =& P(D \text{ and } B_2 ) + P(D \text{ and } B_1 ) + P(D \text{ and } B_0 ) \\
=& P(D|B_2)P(B_2) + P(D|B_1)P(B_1) + P(D|B_0)P(B_0) \\
=& (0.73)(0.10) + (0.40)(0.30) + (0.19)(0.60) \\
=& 0.307.
\end{align*}

The prevalence of deafness among white cats is 0.307.

**Part b, deafness and eye color**

The probability that a white cat has two blue eyes, given that it is deaf, is $P(B_2|D)$: 

::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Using the definition of conditional probability, solve for $P(B_2|D)$. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$
P(B_2|D) = \frac{P(D \text{ and } B_2)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|B_2)P(B_2)}{P(D)} = \dfrac{(0.73)(0.10)}{0.307} = 0.238. 
$$

The probability that a white cat has two blue eyes, given that it is deaf, is 0.238.

:::

The conditional probability $P(B_2 \mid D)$ uses the general version of  Bayes' Rule @eq-bayes-trad-gen,
using the three possible partitions of the event of deafness, $D$. In this problem, it is possible to directly substitute the value $P(D)$  calculated in part a. The expanded denominator in the expression below matches the earlier calculation of $P(D)$.
$$
P(B_2|D) = \dfrac{P(D \text{ and } B_2)}{P(D)} = \dfrac{P(D|B_2)P(B_2)}{P(D|B_2)P(B_2) + P(D|B_1)P(B_1) + P(D|B_0)P(B_0)}. 
$$

**Part c, blindness, deafness and eye color**

::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Reformulate the following from the problem statement into probability notation:

>Suppose that deaf, white cats have an increased chance of being blind, but that the prevalence of blindness differs according to eye color. While deaf, white cats with two blue eyes or two non-blue eyes have probability 0.20 of developing blindness, deaf and white cats with one blue eye have probability 0.40 of developing blindness. White cats that are not deaf have probability 0.10 of developing blindness, regardless of their eye color.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second sentence gives probabilities of blindness, conditional on eye color and being deaf: $P(L|B_2, D) = P(L|B_0, D) = 0.20$, and $P(L|B_1, D) = 0.40$. The third sentence gives the probability that a white cat is blind, given that it is not deaf: $P(L|D^C) = 0.10$.  

:::

Part i asks for the prevalence of blindness among deaf, white cats: $P(L|D)$. As in part a, the event of blindness given deafness can be partitioned by eye color:

$$
P(L|D) = P(L \text{ and } B_0|D) + P(L \text{ and } B_1 | D) + P(L \text{ and } B_2|D).
$${#eq-l-given-d}

::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Expand the @eq-l-given-d using the Multiplication Rule, @eq-mult-rule-two-probs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The general multiplication rule may seem difficult to apply when conditioning is present, but the principle remains the same. Think of the conditioning as a way to restrict the sample space; in this context, conditioning on deafness implies that for this part of the problem, all the cats being considered are deaf (and white). 
	
For instance, consider the first term, $P(L \text{ and } B_0|D)$, the probability of being blind and having two non-blue eyes, given deafness. How could this be rewritten if the probability were simply $P(L \text{ and } B_0)$? 
$$
P(L \text{ and } B_0) = P(L|B_0)P(B_0).
$$
Now, recall that for this part of the problem, the sample space is restricted to deaf (and white) cats. Thus, all of the terms in the expansion should include conditioning on deafness:
$$
P(L \text{ and } B_0|\textcolor{red}{D}) = P(L|\textcolor{red}{D}, B_0)P(B_0|\textcolor{red}{D}). 
$$
Thus, 
$$
P(L|D) = P(L|D, B_0)P(B_0|D) + P(L|D, B_1)P(B_1|D) + P(L|D, B_2)P(B_2|D).
$$

:::

Although $P(L|D, B_0)$, $P(L|D, B_1)$, and $P(L|D, B_2)$ are given in the problem statement, $P(B_0|D$, $P(B_1|D)$, and $P(B_2|D)$ are not. However, note that the probability that a white cat has two blue eyes given that it is deaf, $P(B_2|D)$, was calculated in part b. 

::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=""}

Calculate $P(B_0|D)$ and $P(B_1|D)$. [^probability-445]
:::

[^probability-445]: 
$$
P(B_0|D) = \frac{P(D \text{ and } B_0)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|B_0)P(B_0)}{P(D)} = \frac{(0.19)(0.60)}{0.307} = 0.371.
$$
$$
P(B_1|D) = \frac{P(D \text{ and } B_1)}{P(D)} = \frac{P(D|B_1)P(B_1)}{P(D)} = \frac{(0.40)(0.30)}{0.307} = 0.391.
$$

There is now enough information to calculate $P(L|D)$: 

\begin{align*}
P(L|D) =& P(L \text{ and } B_0|D) + P(L \text{ and } B_1 | D) + P(L \text{ and } B_2 |D) \\
=& P(L|D, B_0)P(B_0|D) + P(L|D, B_1)P(B_1|D) + P(L|D, B_2)P(B_2|D) \\
=& (0.20)(0.371) + (0.40)(0.391) + (0.20)(0.238) \\
=& 0.278.
\end{align*}

The prevalence of blindness among deaf, white cats is 0.278.

Part ii asks for the prevalence of blindness among white cats, $P(L)$. Again, partitioning is an effective strategy. Instead of partitioning by eye color, however, partition by deafness.

::: {.workedexample data-latex=""}

Calculate the prevalence of blindness among white cats, $P(L)$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{align*}
P(L) =& P(L \text{ and } D) + P(L \text{ and } D^C) \\
=& P(L|D)P(D) + P(L|D^C)P(D^C) \\
=& (0.278)(0.307) + (0.10)(1 - 0.307) \\
=& 0.155.
\end{align*}	

$P(D)$ was calculated in part a), while $P(L|D)$ was calculated in part c, i. The conditional probability of blindness given a white cat is not deaf is 0.10, as given in the question statement. By the definition of the complement, $P(D^C) = 1 - P(D)$. 

The prevalence of blindness among white cats is 0.155.

:::

Part iii asks for the probability that a cat has two blue eyes, given that it is white and blind, $P(B_2|L)$. Since all cats being discussed in the problem are white, it is not necessary to condition on coat color.

Start out with the definition of conditional probability:
$$
P(B_2|L) = \dfrac{P(B_2 \text{ and } L)}{P(L)}. 
$$

The key to calculating $P(B_2|L)$ relies on recognizing that the event a cat is blind and has two blue eyes can be partitioned by whether or not the cat is also deaf:
$$
P(B_2|L) = \frac{P(B_2 \text{ and } L \text{ and } D) + P(B_2 \text{ and } L \text{ and } D^C)}{P(L)}.

Draw a tree diagram to organize the events involved in this problem. Identify the branches that represent the possible paths for a white cat to both have two blue eyes and be blind.

When drawing a tree diagram, remember that each branch is conditioned on the previous branches. While there are various possible trees, the goal is to construct a tree for which as many of the branches as possible have known probabilities. 

The tree for this problem will have three branch points, corresponding to either deafness, blindness, or eye color. The first set of branches contain unconditional probabilities, the second set contains conditional probabilities given one event, and the third set contains conditional probabilities given two events.

Recall that the probabilities $P(L|D, B_0)$, $P(L|D, B_1)$, and $P(L|D, B_2)$ were provided in the problem statement. These are the only probabilities conditioned on two events that have previously appeared in the problem, so blindness is the most convenient choice of third branch point. 

It is not obvious whether it will be more efficient to start with deafness or eye color, since unconditional and conditional probabilities related to both have appeared in the problem. @fig-cat-genetics-trees shows two trees, figure (a) starting with deafness and (b) starting with eye color. The two possible paths for a white cat to both have two blue eyes and be blind are shown in green.

Expand @eq-pB2GivenL according to the tree shown in @fig-cat-genetics-trees(a), and solve for $P(B_2|L)$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two of the probabilities have not been calculated previously: $P(B_2|D^C)$ and $P(D^C)$. From the definition of the complement, $P(D^C) = 1 - P(D) = 0.693$; $P(D)$ was calculated in part a. To calculate $P(B_2|D^C)$, apply the definition of conditional probability as in part b, where $P(B_2|D)$ was calculated:
$$
P(B_2|D^C) = \dfrac{P(D^C \text{ and } B_2)}{P(D^C)} = \dfrac{P(D^C|B_2)(P(B_2)}{P(D^C)} = \dfrac{(1-0.73)(0.10)}{0.693} = 0.0390.
$$

\begin{align*}
P(B_2|L) &= \dfrac{(0.20)(0.238)(0.307) + (0.10)(0.0390)(0.693)}{0.155} \\
&= 0.112
\end{align*}
	
The probability that a white cat has two blue eyes, given that it is blind, is 0.112.

[^probability-446]:

A tree diagram is useful for visualizing the different possible ways that a certain set of outcomes can occur. Although conditional probabilities can certainly be calculated without the help of tree diagrams, it is often easy to make errors with a strictly algebraic approach. Once a tree is constructed, it can be used to solve for several probabilities of interest. The following example shows how one of the previous trees can be applied to answer a different question than the one posed in part c, iii.

What is the probability that a white cat has one blue eye and one non-blue eye, given that it is not blind?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate $P(B_1|L^C)$. Start with the definition of conditional probability, then expand.

\begin{align*}
    P(B_1|L^C) &= \frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C)}{P(L^C)} \\
    &= \frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C \text{ and } D) + P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C \text{ and } D^C)}{P(L^C)}.
\end{align*}


@fig-cat-genetics-trees-c is a reproduction of the earlier @fig-cat-genetics-trees(b), with yellow arrows showing the two paths of interest.

As before, expand the numerator and fill in the known values.
	
\begin{align*}
	P(B_1|L^C) =& \frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C \text{ and } D) + P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C \text{ and } D^C)}{P(L^C)}\\
	=& \frac{P(L^C|D, B_1)P(D|B_1)P(B_1) + P(L^C|D^C, B_1)P(D^C|B_1)P(B_1)}{P(L^C)} \\
	=& \frac{\textcolor{red}{\mathbf{P(L^C|D, B_1)}}(0.40)(0.30) + \textcolor{red}{\mathbf{P(L^C|D^C, B_1)P(D^C|B_1)}}(0.30)}{\textcolor{red}{\mathbf{P(L^C)}}}.
	\end{align*} 
	
The probabilities in [**red**]{style="color:red"} are not known. Apply the definition of the complement; recall that the rule for complements holds when an event and its complement are conditioned on the same information: $P(A|B) = 1 - P(A^C|B)$.
	
* $P(L^C) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - 0.155 = 0.845$
* $P(D^C|B_1) = 1 - P(D|B_1) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$
* $P(L^C|D, B_1) = 1 - P(L|D, B_1) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$

	
	The definition of the complement can also be applied to calculate $P(L^C|D^C, B_1)$. The problem statement originally specified that white cats that are not deaf have probability 0.10 of developing blindness regardless of eye color: $P(L|D^C) = 0.10$. Thus, $P(L^C|D^C, B_1) = P(L^C|D^C)$. By the definition of the complement, $P(L^C|D^C) = 1 - P(L|D^C) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.
	
\begin{align*}
	P(B_1|L^C) =& \frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C \text{ and } D) + P(B_1 \text{ and } L^C \text{ and } D^C)}{P(L^C)}\\
	=& \frac{P(L^C|D, B_1)P(D|B_1)P(B_1) + P(L^C|D^C, B_1)P(D^C|B_1)P(B_1)}{P(L^C)} \\
	=& \frac{(0.60)(0.40)(0.30) + (0.90)(0.60)(0.30)}{0.845} \\
	=& 0.277.
\end{align*} 
	
The probability that a white cat has one blue eye and one non-blue eye, given that it is not blind, is 0.277.
