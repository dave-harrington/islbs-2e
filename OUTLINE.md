This document contains the working outline for OpenIntro - Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, Second Edition.

## Chp 1. Introduction to data

- Case Study - LEAP data introduced   
	- Brief mention of two-way table, RR but no details
- Organizing and classifying data   
	- Observations, variables and data matrices    
	     - Crabs introduced, structure of a dataset
	- Types of variables  Very brief section
		- Numerical 
		- Categorical    
	- Summarizing and visualizing data    
		- Categorical data
			- Frequency, relative frequency tables    
			- Bar pots    
		- Numerical data   
			- Intro Portland trees
			- Measures of center and spread (mean, median, IQR, sd) 
			- Graphics: beeswarm
			- Graphics: boxplots and histograms
	- Relationships in data   
		-Two categorical variables    
			- Start with contingency tables, 3x3.  Either WVS or danishED
			- Segmented bar plots 
			-  2x2 tables: measures of association.  Add guided exercises
				Add LEAP to this section.  Discuss OR as a method of estimating association    
		- One categorical, one continuous.  Placed here to put it close to crab data    
		- Two continuous    
			- Scatterplots    
			- Transformations
			- Correlation

- Interpreting complex graphs

- Case study - DDS
