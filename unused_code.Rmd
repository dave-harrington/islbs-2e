@tbl-crabsVarDescriptions provides the definitions of the variables. It is important to check the definitions of variables, as they are not always clear. In the `crabs` data, the definitions specify that the measurements of `width` and `weight` are in metric units and the variable `spine` records the condition of the two spines near the abdomen of each crab.

Like relative frequency tables for the distribution a single categorical variable, contingency tables can be converted to show proportions. @tbl-wvs-edu-health-joint-prop show the proportion of responses for each cell in the table. The number $0.148$ in row `High`, column `Good` is the proportion of respondents with `Education_level` `High` and `Good` `Health_status`.  The values in the cells apart from the row and column totals are called elements of the joint distribution for education and health, since they specify the proportion of times each combination of values occur.  The Total column

[`Portland Tree Inventory project`](https://www.portland.gov/trees/get-involved/treeinventory) is a comprehensive inventory of trees in Portland, Oregon. The project records many variables for each tree, including the date the tree was added to the inventory, its common name,  the financial value of the tree and it value as a carbon storage organism.

Table @tbl-portland-trees shows a few of these variables for a random selection of trees from 4 Portland Parks. ^[Laurelhurst Park, Kenilworth Park, Gove Tom
McCall Waterfront Park and the Columbia Childrens Arboretum], and table @tbl-portland-trees-var-defs shows the definitions of these variables.  (The full dataset is available in the R package [`pdxTrees`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdxTrees/index.html).)

Even relationships between just two variables can take many forms. [The World Bank Data Group](https://data.worldbank.org/) provides free and open access to indicators of economic and social development in countries around the world. The data `wdi_2022` in the [openintro](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package contains data for some of those indicators for the year 2022. @fig-wdi_2022-income-infant-mortality shows a \index{scatterplot} **scatterplot**
