Chapter  (cross-ref here) some primary tools of statistical inference -  point estimates, interval estimates, and hypothesis tests. This chapter discusses settings where these tools are often used, including the analysis of paired observations and the comparison of two or more independent groups. The chapter also covers the important topic of estimating an appropriate sample size when a study is being designed.  The chapter starts with introducing a new distribution, the $t$-distribution, which can be used for small sample sizes.
