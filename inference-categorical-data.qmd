::: {.chapterintro data-latex=""}
Previous chapters discussed methods of inference for numerical data; in this chapter, those methods are extended to categorical data, such as binomial proportions or data in two-way tables. While various details of the methods may change, such as the calculations for a test statistic or the distributions used to find a $p$-value, the core ideas and principles behind inference remain the same.
