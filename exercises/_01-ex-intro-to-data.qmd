*Organizing and classifying data*


**Somerville, MA.** Starting in 2011, city officials in Somerville MA city officials started measuring residents' overall happiness and satisfaction with many aspects of life in Somerville; their goal was to become the first city in the United States to systematically track people's happiness. The Happiness Survey is an initiative of the Mayor's Office of Analytics and Innovation (SomerStat)[https://www.somervillema.gov/departments/mayors-office/somerstat] and has the goal of supporting the local government's understanding of the quality of life in Somerville. 

The happiness survey is sent out every two years to a random sample of Somerville households, with the instruction that each survey should be filled out by one person. The survey asks residents to rate their personal happiness, well-being, and satisfaction with City services. The combined dataset from 2011 to 2019 includes 1,534 responses to many items, a few of which are listed below.  The full dataset including the most recent data can be found at the (Somerville open data portal)[https://data.somervillema.gov/?sortBy=relevance&page=1&pageSize=20]. 


  * `year`: year that response was collected
  * `happy`: happiness rating, on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being most happy
  * `satisfied_life`: rating for satisfaction with life in general, on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being most satisfied
  * `satisfied_somerville`: rating for satisfaction with Somerville as a place to live, on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being most satisfied
  * `age`: age in years
  * `children_home`: whether respondent has children under 18 living at home
  * `ward`: neighborhood ward the respondent lives in
  * `precinct`: neighborhood precinct the respondent lives in
  * `student`: whether respondent is a student
  * `convenient_transport`: rating for how convenient it is to get to where you want to go, on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being most satisfied
  * `direction_somerville`: whether respondent feels the City is headed in the right direction or is on the wrong track
  * `housing`: whether respondent rents or owns their home
  * `primary_transport`: primary form of transportation
  * `lived_here`: years respondent has lived in Somerville

**Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components.** Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.
    During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.
    Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM~10~) in $\mu g/m^3$.
    Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.
    The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM~10~$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.  [@Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000]

  a.  Identify the main research question of the study.

  b.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?

  c.  What are the variables in the study?

**The Buteyko method.**  The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin 
Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko 
method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific 
study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 
asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These 
patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko 
method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, 
asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, 
the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in 
asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. [@McDowan:2003] 

  a. Identify the main research question of the study.

  b. Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?

**Disaster prone counties** On September 30, 2024 The *New York Times* published the article ["Where Americans Have Been Moving Into Disaster-Prone Areas](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/30/climate/americans-moving-hurricane-wildfire-risk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.sE4.bO8u.ZidFCp4iDd2q&smid=url-share) which includes the following visualization. High risk counties were defined as those that regularly get hit by hurricanes and face major wildfires and floods; i.e., counties with high risk of natural disaster and extreme heat.  The latitude and longitude of each county was used to place it on a map of the United States.

**Cheaters, study components.** Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.  Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not.  The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white.
    [@Bucciol:2011]

  a.  Identify the main research question of the study.

  b.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?

  c.  The study's findings can be summarized as follows: *"Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls."* How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings?  State the variables and their types.

**Carbon footprints, I.** The following visualization is from a [data story examining the carbon footprint of plant-based protein sources](https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat) [@owid-less-meat-or-sustainable-meat]. The data first appeared in *Science* in 2018 [@poore2018reducing] and were reprocessed by Our World in Data. The distribution of greenhouse gas emissions per 100 grams of protein is shown for various foods. 

![](./exercises/images/Carbon-footprint-of-protein-foods.png)

  a. Using the information on notations on the plot, what is the structure of the data frame used to construct this plot.  How many rows does it have, what are the variables and what types are the variables?  
  b. What might be causing the variability in the distributions of emissions for each food type?

  c. The white dot on each distribution marks the median greenhouse gas emissions for each food product. Explain why the median instead of the mean is preferable as a measure of center for these distributions.

  d. For the greenhouse gas emissions for 100 grams of protein from cheese, do you expect the mean to be smaller or larger than the median?

  e. Based on the graph, which food would you expect to have the smallest standard deviation of greenhouse gas emissions per 100 grams of protein? Briefly justify your reasoning.

**Carbon footprints, II.** The bar plot below is a different visualization of the carbon footprint of common foods.  For each food type, the length of a bar corresponds to the mean emissions level (in CO~2~ equivalents) per 100 grams of protein.  Some of the food names are different from the earlier plot and the two lists of food types are not identical but there is a large overlap. These data are also from the 2018 *Science* article, but reprocessed by Our World in Data. A version of the plot can found in the data explorer in a [environmetal impact of foods](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food)

**Hyperuricemia and the empirical rule**  Hyperuricemia is the presence of abnormally high levels of uric acid in the blood, a  condition than can lead to kidney stones and gout; hyperuricemia may also be responsible for chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and other metabolic disorders.  A large study in China examined the possible association between dietary magnesium and hyperuricemia; the histogram below shows the distribution of uric acid (in $\mu$mol/L) in a random sample of 500 participants in the study.

  a. Will the value of the statistic for measuring skewness be $< 1$, $= 1$ or $> 1$?

  b.  Would you expect the empirical rule to give accurate estimates of the middle 68% and 95% of the distribution?  Explain your reasoning.
  
  c.  The mean and standard deviation of the distribution are `r mn` and `r med`, respectively.  Regardless of your answer to (b), use the empirical rule to estimate quantiles for the upper 16% and 2.5% of the data.

*Relationships in data*

**Treatment for tuberculosis, I.**  Tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable disease, but the success of a treatment course depends heavily on the patient completing the full course of treatment without interruption, typically 6 - 8 months.  A study conducted in Peru examined patient characteristics associated with a treatment interruption of more than 2 months.  The table below shows the relationship between the explanatory variable age of a participant (measured in decades) an whether or not treatment was interrupted (the response variable).

**Meat consumption and life expectancy.** In data collected for @You:2022, total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at birth) in 175 countries.  Meat intake is measured in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013).  The two ridge plots show an association between income and meat consumption (higher income countries tend to eat more meat) and an association between income and life expectancy (higher income countries have higher life expectancy).

  a.  Do the graphs above demonstrate that meat consumption and life expectancy are associated?  That is, can you tell if countries with low meat consumption have low life expectancy?  Explain.

  b.  Let's assume that you had a plot comparing meat consumption and life expectancy, and they *do* seem associated. Your friend says that the plot shows that high meat consumption leads to a longer life.  You correctly say, no, we can't tell if there is a causal relationship because the relationship is confounded by income level. Explain what you mean.

  c.  How can you investigate the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy in the presence of confounding variables (like income)?

 **Migraine and acupuncture.** A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture.
    To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 individuals who identified as female diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control.
    Forty-three (43) patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines.
    Forty-six (46) patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations).
    Twenty-four (24) hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free.
    Results are summarized in the contingency table below.
    Also provided is a figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks.

  a. Using the legend in the upper left of the figure, interpret the 45 degree line in the plot.
  
  b. The accompanying story reported that "Almost one-quarter of adults in the world smoke tobacco. However, there are significant differences by gender.  More than one-third of men smoke, while less than one in ten women do."  What is the approximate ratio of male to female smokers in the world?  
  
  c. Approximately what percentage of men and women smoke in Myanmar?
  
  d. In Myanmar, what is the ratio of the proportion of male to female smokers?
  
  e.  What can be learned from the cluster of purple points in the lower left corner of the plot?

[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) (OWD) is an open-access publication featuring research and data to make progress against large global problems. It scatterplot of proportions of male and female smokers can be found on OWD.   Visit the website (there is a useful "Browse by Topic" on the top toolbar) to find an article that interests you and write a brief paragraph (no more than 4 sentences) about an idea or visualization you found compelling.  Include a link to the article in your answer. Here are two examples: [this article](https://ourworldindata.org/how-do-researchers-estimate-the-death-toll-caused-by-each-risk-factor-whether-its-smoking-obesity-or-air-pollution) explores how researchers estimate how many deaths are caused by risk factors; [this article](https://ourworldindata.org/how-do-researchers-study-the-prevalence-of-mental-illnesses) examines how researchers collect data on mental health and discusses how reliable that data may be.

**Flossing habits** Suppose that an anonymous questionnaire is given to patients at a dentist's office once they arrive for an appointment. One of the questions asks "How often do you floss?", and four answer options are provided: a) at least twice a day, b) at least once a day, c) a few times a week, and d) a few times a month. At the end of a week, the answers are tabulated: 31 individuals chose answer a), 55 chose b), 39 chose c), and 12 chose d). 

  a. Describe how these data could be numerically and graphically summarized.
  
  b. Assess whether the results of this survey can be generalized to provide information about flossing habits in the general population.

**Mammal life spans.** Data were collected on life spans (in years) and gestation lengths (in days) for 62 mammals. A scatterplot of life span versus length of gestation is shown below.[^_01-intro-to-data-3] [@Allison+Cicchetti:1975]

  a.  What type of an association is apparent between life span and length of gestation?

  b.  What type of an association would you expect to see if the axes of the plot were reversed, i.e., if we plotted length of gestation versus life span?

  c.  Are life span and length of gestation independent? Explain your reasoning.

**Childhood mortality, I.**  The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the explanatory variable female education (average number of years in school) and the response variable childhood mortality rate (the number of deaths under the age of 5 per 100 births). ^[United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (2024) – with major processing by Our World in Data]  The data in the plot correspond to the `r n_cc` where data on these variables were available from the full set of `r n_countries`.  The red line in the plot is a straight line that best fits the data.

  a. Describe the relationship between these variables.  Is it positive or negative, linear or nonlinear?
  
  b. Which of the following statements are true about the correlation between childhood mortality and education for women?  give a reason for your answer.
  
  (1) The correlation is negative and between -0.20 and -0.40.     
  (2) The correlation is negative between -0.60 and -0.90;    
  (3) The correlation is zero because there are regions of the plot where the relationship is not linear;    
  (4) Correlation cannot be calculated in this case.
  
  c.  What does the red line suggest about the value of assuming that relationship between the childhood mortality and female education is perfectly linear?
  
  d. Data on both variables are not available for `r n_countries - n_cc` countries.  If this data became available where do you think the data points would lie in the scatterplot?  Explain your reasoning.

**Childhood mortality, II**  The data used for the scatterplot in the previous exercise was used by Our World in Data to produce the scatterplot below. [@UN_IGME_2024].  The two plots use the same plot type (a scatterplot) to show the same relationship between the explanatory variable female education level and the response childhood mortality, but there obvious differences.

  a. List  three pieces of additional information provided by this plot compared to the earlier one and specify the way in which that information is displayed in the plot.
  
  b.  If you were working with a research team interested in the specifics of the relationship between the explanatory and response variables, which plot would you prefer?  Explain why.
  
  c. If you were part of a team considering interventions to reduce the rate of childhood mortality  in high risk countries, which plot would you prefer?  Explain why.

**Anger and cardiovascular health** Trait anger is defined as a relatively stable personality trait that is manifested in the frequency, intensity, and duration of feelings associated with anger. People with high trait anger have rage and fury more often, more intensely, and with long-lasting episodes than people with low trait anger. It is thought that people with high trait anger might be particularly susceptible to coronary heart disease; 12,986 participants were recruited for a study examining this hypothesis. Participants were followed for five years. [@williams2000anger]

The following table shows data for the participants identified as having normal blood pressure 

|      |    | Trait anger score |     |   | 
|:---------|--------:|--------:|--------:|------:|
|  **CHD event** |  Low   |  Moderate  | High   | **Total**  |
|  Yes    |  53   |    110  |   27   | 190   |
|   No    |  3057 |    4704 |   606  | 8284  |
|  **Total**  |  3110 |    4731 |   633 | 8474   |


  a. What percentage of participants have moderate anger scores?
  
  b. What percentage of individuals who experienced a CHD event have moderate anger scores?
  
  c. What percentage of participants with high trait anger scores experienced a CHD event (i.e., heart attack)?
  
  d. What percentage of participants with low trait anger scores experienced a CHD event?
  
  e. Are individuals with high trait anger more likely to experience a CHD event than individuals with low trait anger? 
  
  f. Researchers also collected data on various participant traits, such as level of blood cholesterol (measured in mg/dL). What graphical summary might be useful for examining how blood cholesterol level differs between anger groups?


*Confounding, Simpson's paradox*

**Confounders** For each of the following scenarios, list at least one confounding/lurking variable that makes the apparent association misleading.  In some cases the confounder is clear; in others you may  have to speculate about it.

  a. Excessive coffee drinking is leads to an increased risk of lung cancer.
  
  b. Living near high voltage electrical transmission lines increases the risk of cancer.
  
  c. Using sun screen causes skin cancer.
  
  d. In large families, being born as the fifth child leads to Down syndrome.
  
  e. Frequent use of a ride-sharing service (such as Uber or Lyft) causes weight gain.
  
**Confounders** For each of the following scenarios, list at least one confounding/lurking variable that makes the apparent association misleading.  In some cases the confounder is clear; in others you may  have to speculate about it.

  a. Eating ice cream causes skin cancer.
  
  b. Disproportionately more burglaries occur between June and September in North America, so higher daily temperature causes burglars to  be more active.
  
  c. Since international childhood mortality rates decrease with increasing education levels of females age 15 - 64, women with more education are better able to protect their children from diseases.
  
  d. Playing recordings of Mozart piano sonatas for in infant increase the chance they will be accepted to an elite University.
  
  e. Disproportionately more bicycle accidents occur between June and September in North America, so higher daily temperature cause cyclists to be careless.

  f. The polio epidemic in North America in the 1950s was caused by eating ice cream. Hint:  Some research on the internet might help.
  
**Clinic billing**  Suppose the age distributions for the two clinics in the example of clinic billing in @sec-developmental-disability are more nearly equal: 60 of the 200 patients in Clinic A are less than 50 years old, while 140 of the Clinic B patients are less than 50.

  a. What will be the average billing for the two clinics?
  
  b. Explain to someone who has not taken statistics how this differs from the example in the text and why?
  
**College admissions**  Suppose a private, for profit college prepares students to work in health care.  The college has three degree programs: pharmacist, physician assistant, and nurse practitioner.  In the previous year, 1000 applicants applied for admission.  The table below shows hypothetical admissions data by sex of the applicant.

  a. What is the overall admissions rate at this college?
  
  b. What are the admissions rates for females and males?
  
  c. Does the college appear to discriminate against  females in its admissions decisions?  Explain your answer.
  
  d. Show that the number of females admitted is a weighted average of the number of females applying to each program weighted by the admissions proportion for the programs.


|  Program     | Females accepted (of applicants)  | Males accepted (of applicants) |
|:-------------|----------------------------------:|--------------------------------:|
| Pharmacy    |   60 of 86                            |    400 of 700                |
| Physician assistant |   50 of 220                    |  60 of 260                  |
| Nurse practitioner  |  24 of 70                      | 5 of 15                    |

**Create a paradox**  Suppose a large health care organization recently hired hired 50 additional nurses and 20 additional IT staff.  Construct an example of Simpson's paradox in which the organization appeared to discriminate against males.

**Florence Nightingale.** Florence Nightingale was a nurse in the Crimean War and an early statistician. In her notes, she opined, "In comparing the deaths of one hospital with those of another, any statistics are justly considered absolutely valueless which do not give the ages, the sexes, and the diseases of all the cases." [@nightingale:1859]

  a.  Nightingale describes three confounding variables to consider when comparing death rates across hospitals.  What are they?  Describe what makes each variable potentially confounding.

  b.  Provide two additional potential confounding variables for this situation.  Check to make sure that the variables are associated with both the explanatory variable (hospital) and the response variable (death).

  c.  Why does Nightingale say that the statistics are "valueless" if given without being broken down by age, sex, and disease?  xsExplain.
