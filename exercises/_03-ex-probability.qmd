**True or false.** Determine if the statements 
below are true or false, and explain your reasoning.

  a. Assume that a couple has an equal chance of having a boy or a girl. If a couple's previous three children have all been boys, then the chance that their next child is a boy is somewhat less than 50%.
  
  b. If a fair coin is tossed many times and the last eight tosses are all heads, 
then the chance that the next toss will be heads is somewhat less than 50%.

  c. Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a 
full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.

  d.  Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards 
are mutually exclusive events.

<!--- os4 3.6 --->

**Rolling dice.** If you roll a pair of fair dice, what is 
the probability of

  a. getting a sum of 1?
  
  b. getting a sum of 5?
  
  c. getting a sum of 12?
  
<!--- oi-biostat 2.3  --->

**Colorblindness.**  Red-green colorblindness is a commonly inherited form of colorblindness; the gene involved is transmitted on the X chromosome in a recessive manner. If a male inherits an affected X chromosome, he is necessarily colorblind (genotype $X^{-}Y$). However, a female can only be colorblind if she inherits two defective copies (genotype $X^{-}X^{-}$); heterozygous females are not colorblind. Suppose that a couple consists of a genotype $X^{+}Y$ male and a genotype $X^{+}X^{-}$ female.

  a. What is the probability of the couple producing a colorblind male?

  b. True or false: Among the couple's offspring, colorblindness and female sex are mutually exclusive events.
  
<!--- oibiostat 2.4  ---> 

**Diabetes and hypertension.**  Diabetes and hypertension are two of the most common diseases in Western, industrialized nations. In the United States, approximately 9% of the population have diabetes, while about 30% of adults have high blood pressure. The two diseases frequently occur together: an estimated 6% of the population have both diabetes and hypertension.

  a. Are having diabetes and having hypertension disjoint?
  
  b. Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated probabilities.
\item Let $A$ represent the event of having diabetes, and $B$ the event of having hypertension. Calculate $P(A \text{ or } B)$. 

  c.What percent of Americans have neither hypertension nor diabetes?
  
  d. Is the event of someone being hypertensive independent of the event that someone has diabetes?

**Educational attainment by gender.** The table 
	below shows the distribution of education level attained by US residents by 
	gender based on data collected during the 2010 American Community Survey. ^[@eduSexMod]

| Bachelor's degree                          | 0.16 | 0.17 |
| Graduate or professional degree            | 0.09 | 0.09 |
| **Total**                                  | **1.00** | **1.00** |	

  a. What is the probability that a randomly chosen individual is a high school graduate? Assume that there is an equal proportion of males and females in the population.

  b. Define Event $A$ as having a graduate or professional degree. Calculate the probability of the complement, $A^c$.
		
  c. What is the probability that a randomly chosen man has at least a 
		Bachelor's degree?
		
  d. What is the probability that a randomly chosen woman has at least a 
		Bachelor's degree?

  c. What is the probability that a man and a woman getting married both have at 
		least a Bachelor's degree? Note any assumptions made -- are they reasonable?

**Poverty and language.** The American Community 
Survey is an ongoing survey that provides data every year to give communities the 
current information they need to plan investments and services. The 2010 American 
Community Survey estimates that 14.6% of Americans live below the poverty line, 
20.7% speak a language other than English (foreign language) at home, and 4.2% 
fall into both categories. ^[@poorLangMod]

  a. Are living below the poverty line and speaking a foreign language at home 
disjoint?

  b. Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated 
probabilities.

  c. What percent of Americans live below the poverty line and only speak 
English at home?

  d. What percent of Americans live below the poverty line or speak a foreign 
language at home?

  e. What percent of Americans live above the poverty line and only speak 
English at home? 

  f. Is the event that someone lives below the poverty line independent of the 
event that the person speaks a foreign language at home?

**Urgent care visits.** Urgent care centers are open beyond typical office hours and provide a broader range of services than that of many primary care offices. A study conducted to collect information about urgent care centers in the United States reported that in one week, 15.8% of centers saw 0-149 patients, 33.7% saw 150-299 patients, 28.8% saw 300-449 patients, and 21.7% saw 450 or more patients. Assume that the data can be treated as a probability distribution of patient visits for any given week. 

  a. What is the probability that three random urgent care centers in a county all see between 300-449 patients in a week? Note any assumptions made. Are the assumptions reasonable?
  
  b. What is the probability that ten random urgent care centers throughout a state all see 450 or more patients in a week? Note any assumptions made. Are the assumptions reasonable?
		
  c. With the information provided, is it possible to compute the probability that one urgent care center sees between 150-299 patients in one week and 300-449 patients in the next week? Explain why or why not.

**School absences.** Data collected at elementary 
schools in DeKalb County, GA suggest that each year roughly 25% of students miss 
exactly one day of school, 15% miss 2 days, and 28% miss 3 or more days due to 
sickness. ^[@Mizan:2011]

  a. What is the probability that a student chosen at random doesn't miss any 
days of school due to sickness this year?

  b. What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses no more than 
one day?

  c. What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses at least one 
day?

  d. If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what is the 
probability that neither kid will miss any school? Note any assumptions made and evaluate how reasonable they are.

  e. If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what is the 
probability that both kids will miss some school, i.e. at least one day? Note any assumptions made and evaluate how reasonable they are.

**Disjoint vs. independent.**  In parts a and b, 
identify whether the events are disjoint, independent, or neither (events cannot 
be both disjoint and independent).

  a. You and a randomly selected student from your class both earn A's in this 
course. 

  b. You and your class study partner both earn A's in this course.

  c. If two events can occur at the same time, must they be dependent?

**Health coverage, frequencies.** The 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey 
designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging 
health trends. The following table summarizes two variables for the respondents: 
health status and health coverage, which describes whether each respondent had 
health insurance. ^[@data:BRFSS2010]

**Global warming.**  A Pew Research poll asked 
1,306 Americans ``From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that 
the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few 
decades, or not?". The table below shows the distribution of responses by party 
and ideology (labeled Group), where the counts have been replaced with relative frequencies.

**ABO blood groups.**   The ABO blood group system consists of four different blood groups, which describe whether an individual's red blood cells carry the A antigen, B antigen, both, or neither. The ABO gene has three alleles: ${I}^{A}$, ${I}^{B}$, and *i*. The *i* allele is recessive to both ${I}^{A}$ and ${I}^{B}$, while the ${I}^{A}$ and ${I}^{B}$ alleles are codominant. Individuals homozygous for the *i* allele are known as blood group O, with neither A nor B antigens.
	
| **Alleles inherited** | **Blood type** |
|----------------------|---------------|
| $I^A$ and $I^A$      | A |
| $I^A$ and $I^B$      | AB |
| $I^A$ and $i$        | A |
| $I^B$ and $I^B$      | B |
| $I^B$ and $i$        | B |
| $i$ and $i$          | O |
	
Blood group follows the rules of Mendelian single-gene inheritance -- alleles are inherited independently from either parent, with probability 0.5.
	
  a. Suppose that both members of a couple have Group AB blood. What is the probability that a child of this couple will have Group A blood?
  
  b. Suppose that one member of a couple is genotype $I^{B}i$ and the other is $I^{A}i$. What is the probability that their first child has Type O blood and the next two do not?
  
  c. Suppose that one member of a couple is genotype $I^{B}i$ and the other is $I^{A}i$. Given that one child has Type O blood and two do not, what is the probability of the first child having Type O blood?

**Assortative mating** Assortative mating is a 
nonrandom mating pattern where individuals with similar genotypes and/or 
phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than what would be expected 
under a random mating pattern. Researchers studying this topic collected data on 
eye colors of 204 Scandinavian men and their female partners. The table below 
summarizes the results. ^[Laeng:2007]
