<!--  6 oi_biostat hummingbirds, should we use data in csv file?-->

**Hummingbird taste behavior** Researchers hypothesized that a particular taste receptor in hummingbirds, T1R1-T1R3, played a primary role in dictating taste behavior; specifically, in determining which compounds hummingbirds detect as sweet. In a series of field tests, hummingbirds were presented simultaneously with two filled containers, one containing test stimuli and a second containing sucrose. The test stimuli included aspartame, erythritol, water, and sucrose. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that tastes sweet to humans, but is not detected by hummingbird T1R1-T1R3 , while erythritol is an artificial sweetener known to activate T1R1-T1R3. [@baldwin2014evolution]

Data were collected on how long a hummingbird drank from a particular container for a given trial, measured in seconds. For example, in one field test comparing aspartame and sucrose, a hummingbird drank from the aspartame container for 0.54 seconds and from the sucrose container for 3.21 seconds. 

  a. Which tests are controls? Which tests are treatments?

  b. Identify the response variable(s) in the study. Are they numerical or categorical?

  c.  Describe the main research question.

**Egg coloration** The evolutionary significance of variation in egg coloration among birds is not fully understood. One hypothesis suggests that egg coloration may be an indication of female quality, with healthier females being capable of depositing blue-green pigment into eggshells instead of using it for themselves as an antioxidant. In a study conducted on 32 collared flycatchers, half of the females were given supplementary diets before and during egg laying. Eggs were measured for darkness of blue color using spectrophotometry; for example, the mean amount of blue-green chroma was 0.594 absorbance units. Egg mass was also recorded.

**Herbal remedies**  Echinacea has been widely used as an herbal remedy for the common cold, but previous studies evaluating its efficacy as a remedy have produced conflicting results. In a new study, researchers randomly assigned 437 volunteers to receive either a placebo or echinacea treatment before being infected with rhinovirus. Healthy young adult volunteers were recruited for the study from the University of Virginia community. [@turner2005evaluation]

**Vitamin supplements.**  In order to assess the effectiveness 
	of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, 
	researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A 
	quarter of the patients were randomly assigned a placebo, and the rest were randomly allocated between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. [@Audera:2001]

**Chicks and antioxidants**  Environmental factors early in life can have long-lasting effects on an organism. In one study, researchers examined whether dietary supplementation with vitamins C and E influences body mass and corticosterone level in yellow-legged gull chicks. Chicks were randomly assigned to either the nonsupplemented group or the vitamin supplement experimental group. The initial study group consisted of 108 nests, with 3 eggs per nest. Chicks were assessed at age 7 days. (Adapted from @kim2013vitamins)

**Eat better, feel better**  In a public health study on the effects of consumption of fruits and vegetables on psychological well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three 
groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to take a nightly survey on their smartphones. 

Participants were student volunteers at the University of Otago, New Zealand.At the end of the 14-day study, only participants in the third group showed improvements to their psychological well-being across the 14-days relative to the other groups.[@conner2017let]

*Observational studies*

<!--  23 oi_biostat problem, odd -->


**Alcohol consumption and STIs**  An observational study published in *The American Journal of Preventive Medicine* investigated the effects of an increased alcohol sales tax in Maryland on the rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia. After a tax increase from 6% to 9% in 2011, the statewide gonorrhea rate declined by 24%, the equivalent of 1,600 cases per year. In a statement to the *New York Times*, the lead author of the paper was quoted saying, 

> Policy makers should consider raising liquor taxes if they're looking for ways to prevent sexually
> transmitted infections. In the year and a half following the alcohol tax rise in Maryland, 
> this prevented 2,400 cases of gonorrhea and saved half a million dollars in health care costs.

Explain whether the lead author's statement is accurate. [@staras2016maryland]

**Cheaters, II.**
	Exercise ref? introduces a study where researchers 
	studying the relationship between honesty, age, and self-control conducted an 
	experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. The researchers asked 
	each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) 
	on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. 
	Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given 
	any explicit instructions. Differences were observed in the cheating rates in the
	instruction and no instruction groups, as well as some differences across 
	children's characteristics within each group.

**Flawed reasoning** Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning 
in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should 
have done differently if they wanted to make such conclusions.

  a. Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they 
are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions 
asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to 
spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85% said 
``no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great 
majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids 
after school.

  b. A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who 
recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during 
pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems 
is conducted 3 years later, however, only 567 of these women are reached at the 
same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative 
of all mothers.

  c. An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do

**Reading the news** Below are excerpts from two 
articles published in the *NY Times*:

  a. An article titled *Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia*
states the following: [@news:smokingDementia]

> Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who 
> participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, 
> when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had 
> dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular 
> dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that 
> pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, 
> and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; 
> and twice the risk for more than two packs.

Based on this study, can it be concluded that smoking causes dementia later in 
life? Explain your reasoning.

  b. Another article titled *The School Bully Is Sleepy* states the 
following: [@news:bullySleep]


> The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from 
> parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to 
> assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were 
> identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior 
> or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and 
> those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown 
> symptoms of sleep disorders.

A friend of yours who read the article says, ``The study shows that sleep 
disorders lead to bullying in school children." Is this statement justified? 
If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this 
study?

*This section contains open-ended discussion questions and prompts for exploring data on the web.  They are most valuable when done in groups or in smaller course section meetings.  No example answers are provided, but questions usually provide hints on how to get started.*

**Sampling bias** Read an article discussing the implications of sampling bias in a particular setting and share something you learned. Some possible options are these articles discussing [crime data that shows racial bias](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/), [possible steps for making biobanks more representative](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/industry-dx/how-bias-can-creep-into-medical-databanks-drive-precision-health-and-clinical-ai), [how voluntary recruitment leads to non-response bias in public health monitoring](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4189-8), [the importance of diverse clinical trial participation](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2215609), and [the importance of random sampling for tracking COVID-19 infections](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00336-8).

**Data fraud** There have been many well-publicized instances of scientific misconduct, but the general public tends to be unaware of the extent of data fraud. Read about a specific case of scientific misconduct and then share something you found surprising (or any questions that came to mind). What was your reaction to the story? Some possible options are these articles discussing [allegations that Francesca Gino's research contains fraudulent data](https://www.science.org/content/article/after-honesty-researcher-s-retractions-colleagues-expand-scrutiny-her-work)\footnote{You might also find it interesting to look at the blog posts detailing evidence of fraud on \href{https://datacolada.org/109}{data colada}.}, [the Surgisphere COVID-19 scandal](https://www.science.org/content/article/whos-blame-these-three-scientists-are-heart-surgisphere-covid-19-scandal), [the prevalence of photoshopped images in scientific publications](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/29/opinion/science-fraud-image-manipulation-photoshop.html), [false claims made about the properties of adult stem cells](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-hearts-stem-cells/) and [a former social psychology professor who fabricated data at least 50 times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/magazine/diederik-stapels-audacious-academic-fraud.html).

**Nonrandom samples** Attitudes about the utility of non-random samples can vary widely. In [this article, "Inference using non-random samples? Stop right there!"](https://rss-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/pdf/10.1111/1740-9713.01568), the authors caution against conducting inference without a random sample. In contrast, Andrew Gelman (professor of statistics and political science at Columbia) and David Rothschild (economist at Microsoft Research) [argued in favor of modern approaches to supplement traditional probability polling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/04/modern-polling-requires-both-sampling-and-adjustment/). [This more recent article from *Trends in Ecology & Evolution*](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(23)00005-8) discusses how non-probability samples can be used for monitoring biodiversity and also references the Big Data Paradox. Share something you learned from reading one of these articles, particularly with reference to understanding the real-world challenges of obtaining a representative sample.
  
**Election polling** Election polling is a key domain in which making accurate estimates from a sample receives a lot of public attention. Pew Research Center recently released ["Key things to know about U.S. election polling in 2024"](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/28/key-things-to-know-about-us-election-polling-in-2024/) which provides some insights about polling. If you would like to dive into more technical details, check out Michael Bailey's [article for the *Harvard Data Science Review*](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ejk5yhgv/release/4) which discusses a new paradigm for conceptualizing survey error; in particular, explore the [Paradigm Lost](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ejk5yhgv#paradigm-lost) section and the helpful figures, such as [Figure 1](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ejk5yhgv#nhxnpwyoezs). Share something you learned from reading one of these articles; did anything seem particularly surprising? What do you think the public should be more aware of when it comes to interpreting the results of election polling?
  
**Online surveys** Online opt-in surveys have become an increasingly popular way to conduct polls. Pew Research Center [conducted a study](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2018/01/26/for-weighting-online-opt-in-samples-what-matters-most/) examining the effectiveness of various strategies for adjusting samples so that they more closely match the population. Pew also examined [how bogus respondents might affect poll results](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/assessing-the-risks-to-online-polls-from-bogus-respondents/). The reports are long, so feel free to focus on a particular section that interests you. Share something you learned from one of the reports. Do you now feel more or less trust in the results of online opt-in polls (and why)?
